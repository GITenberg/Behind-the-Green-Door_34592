<br /><i>TROUBLE FOR MR. PARKER</i></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Watch me coming down the mountain, Mrs.
Weems! This one is a honey! An open christiana turn
with no brakes dragging!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny Parker, clad in a new black and red snowsuit,
twisted her agile young body sideways, causing
the small rug upon which she stood to skip across the
polished floor of the living room. She wriggled her
slim hips again, and it slipped in the opposite direction
toward Mrs. Weems who was watching from
the kitchen doorway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Coming down the mountain, my eye!&rdquo; exclaimed
the housekeeper, laughing despite herself. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be
coming down on your head if you don&rsquo;t stop those
antics. I declare, you&rsquo;ve acted like a crazy person ever
since your father rashly agreed to take you to Pine
Top for the skiing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have to break in my new suit and limber up my
muscles somehow,&rdquo; said Penny defensively. &ldquo;One
can&rsquo;t practice outdoors when there&rsquo;s no snow. Now
watch this one, Mrs. Weems. It&rsquo;s called a telemark.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_2">[2]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll reduce that rug to shreds before you&rsquo;re
through,&rdquo; sighed the housekeeper. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you think
of anything else to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; agreed Penny cheerfully, &ldquo;but it wouldn&rsquo;t
be half as much fun. How do you like my suit?&rdquo; She
darted across the room to preen before the full length
mirror.</p>
<p>A red-billed cap pulled at a jaunty angle over her
blond curls, Penny made a striking figure in the well
tailored suit of dark wool. Her eyes sparkled with
the joy of youth and it was easy for her to smile. She
was an only child, the daughter of Anthony Parker,
editor and publisher of the <i>Riverview Star</i>, and her
mother had died when she was very young.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks like a good, practical suit,&rdquo; conceded the
housekeeper.</p>
<p>Penny made a wry face. &ldquo;Is that the best you can
say for it? Louise Sidell and I shopped all over Riverview
to get the snappiest number out, and then you
call it <i>practical</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you know you look cute in it,&rdquo; laughed Mrs.
Weems. &ldquo;So what&rsquo;s the use of telling you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before Penny could reply the telephone rang and
the housekeeper went to answer it. She returned to
the living room a moment later to say that Penny&rsquo;s
father was in need of free taxi service home from the
office.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_3">[3]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Tell him I&rsquo;ll be down after him in two shakes of
a kitten&rsquo;s tail!&rdquo; Penny called, making for the stairway.</p>
<p>She took the steps two at a time and had climbed
halfway out of the snowsuit by the time she reached
the bedroom. A well aimed kick landed the garment
on the bed, and then because it was very new and very
choice she took time to straighten it out. Seizing a
dress blindly from the closet, she wriggled into it and
ran downstairs again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some more skiing equipment may come while I&rsquo;m
gone,&rdquo; she shouted to Mrs. Weems who was in the
kitchen. &ldquo;I bought a new pair of skis, a couple of
poles, three different kinds of wax and a pair of red
mittens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you order the store sent out and be
done with it?&rdquo; responded the housekeeper dryly.</p>
<p>Penny pulled on her heavy coat and hurried to the
garage where two cars stood side by side. One was a
shining black sedan of the latest model, the other, a
battered, unwashed vehicle whose reputation was as
discouraging as its appearance. &ldquo;Leaping Lena,&rdquo; as
Penny called her car, had an annoying habit of running
up repair bills, and then repaying its long suffering
owner by refusing to start on cold winter days.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lena, you get to stay in your cozy nest this time,&rdquo;
Penny remarked, climbing into her father&rsquo;s sedan.
&ldquo;Dad can&rsquo;t stand your rattle and bounce.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_4">[4]</div>
<p>The powerful engine started with a blast. While
Mrs. Weems watched anxiously from the kitchen
window, Penny shot the car out backwards, wheeling
it around the curve of the driveway with speed and
ease. She liked to handle her father&rsquo;s automobile, and
since he did not enjoy driving, she frequently called
at the newspaper office to take him home.</p>
<p>The <i>Star</i> building occupied a block in the downtown
section of Riverview. Penny parked the car beside
the loading dock at the rear, and took an elevator
to the editorial rooms. Nearly all of the desks were
deserted at this late hour of the afternoon. But Jerry
Livingston, one of the best reporters on the paper,
was still pecking out copy on a noisy typewriter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi, Penny!&rdquo; he observed, grinning as she brushed
past his desk. &ldquo;Have you caught any more witch
dolls?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not for the front page,&rdquo; she flung back at him.
&ldquo;My newspaper career is likely to remain in a state of
<i>status quo</i> for the next two weeks. Dad and I are
heading for Pine Top to dazzle the natives with our
particular brand of skiing. Don&rsquo;t you envy us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I certainly would, if you were going.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If!&rdquo; exclaimed Penny indignantly. &ldquo;Of course
we&rsquo;re going! We leave Thursday by plane. Dad needs
a vacation and this time I know he won&rsquo;t try to wiggle
out of it at the last minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I hope not,&rdquo; replied Jerry in a skeptical
voice. &ldquo;Your father needs a good rest, Penny. But I
have a sneaking notion you&rsquo;re in for a disappointment
again.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_5">[5]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What makes you say that, Jerry? Dad promised
me faithfully&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, I know,&rdquo; he nodded, &ldquo;but there have been
developments.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An important story?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s more serious than that. But you talk with
him. I may have the wrong slant on the situation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not without misgiving, Penny went on to her
father&rsquo;s private office and tapped on the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; he called in a gruff voice, and as she
entered, waved her into a chair. &ldquo;You arrived a little
sooner than I expected, Penny. Mind waiting a few
minutes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Studying her father&rsquo;s lean, tired-looking face,
Penny decided that something <i>was</i> wrong. He seemed
unusually worried and nervous.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A hard day, Dad?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>Mr. Parker finished straightening a sheaf of papers
before he glanced up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I hadn&rsquo;t intended to tell you until later, but
I may as well. I&rsquo;m afraid our trip is off&mdash;at least as
far as I&rsquo;m concerned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Dad!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a big disappointment, Penny. The truth is, I&rsquo;m
in a spot of trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that the usual condition of a newspaper publisher?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">[6]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he smiled, &ldquo;but there are different degrees
of trouble, and this is the worst possible. The <i>Star</i>
has been sued for libel, a matter of fifty odd thousand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fifty thousand!&rdquo; gasped Penny. &ldquo;But of course
you&rsquo;ll win the suit!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not at all sure of it.&rdquo; Anthony Parker spoke
grimly. &ldquo;My lawyer tells me that Harvey Maxwell
has a strong case against the paper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Harvey Maxwell?&rdquo; repeated Penny thoughtfully.
&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t he the man who owns the Riverview Hotel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and a chain of other hotels and lodges
throughout the country. Harvey Maxwell is a rather
well known sportsman. He lives lavishly, travels a
great deal, and in general is a hard, shrewd business
man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s made a large amount of money from his
hotels, hasn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maxwell acquired a fortune from some source,
but I&rsquo;ve always had a doubt that it came from the
hotel business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why is he suing the <i>Star</i> for libel, Dad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Early this fall, while I was out of town for a day
DeWitt let a story slip through which should have
been killed. It was an interview with a football player
named Bill Morcrum who was quoted as saying that
he had been approached by Maxwell who offered him
a bribe to throw an important game.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What would be the reason behind that?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">[7]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Maxwell is thought by those in the know to have
a finger in nearly every dishonest sports scheme ever
pulled off in this town. He places heavy wagers, and
seldom comes out on the losing end. But the story
never should have been published.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was true though?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m satisfied it was,&rdquo; replied Mr. Parker. &ldquo;However,
it always is dangerous to make insinuations
against a man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t the story be proven? I should think with
the football player&rsquo;s testimony you would have a
good case.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the trouble, Penny. This boy, Bill Morcrum,
now claims he never made any such accusation
against Maxwell. He says the reporter misquoted him
and twisted his statements.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who covered the story, Dad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A man named Glower, a very reliable reporter.
He swears he made no mistake, and I am inclined to
believe him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why did the football player change his
story?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have no proof, but it&rsquo;s a fairly shrewd guess that
he was approached by Maxwell a second time. Either
he was threatened or offered a bribe which was large
enough to sway him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With both Maxwell and the football player standing
together, it does rather put you on the spot,&rdquo;
Penny acknowledged. &ldquo;What are you going to do?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">[8]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll fight the case, of course, but unless we
can prove that our story was accurate, we&rsquo;re almost
sure to lose. I&rsquo;ve asked Bill Morcrum to come to my
office this afternoon, and he promised he would. He&rsquo;s
overdue now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Anthony Parker glanced at his watch and scowled.
Getting up from the swivel chair he began to pace to
and fro across the room.</p>
<p>A buzzer on his desk gave three sharp, staccato
signals.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Morcrum must be here now!&rdquo; the editor exclaimed
in relief. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll want to see him alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny arose to leave. As she went out the doorway
she met the receptionist, accompanied by an
awkward, oversized youth who shuffled his feet in
walking. He grinned at her in a sheepish way and
entered the private office.</p>
<p>While Penny waited, she entertained herself by
reading all the comic strips she could find in the out-of-town
exchange papers. In the adjoining room she
could hear the rhythmical thumping, clicking sound
of the <i>Star&rsquo;s</i> teletype machines. She wandered aimlessly
into the room to read the copy just as the machines
typed it out, a story from Washington, one
from Chicago, another from Los Angeles. It was
fascinating to watch the print appear like magic upon
the long rolls of copy paper.</p>
<p>Presently, the teletype attendant, young Billy
Stevens, came dashing into the room.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">[9]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, hello, Miss Parker,&rdquo; he said with a bashful
grin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, Billy,&rdquo; Penny answered cordially. She
studied the keyboard of the sending teletype machine,
running her fingers over the letters. &ldquo;I wish I
could work this thing,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing to it if you can run a typewriter,&rdquo;
answered Billy. &ldquo;Just a minute, I&rsquo;ll throw it off the
line on to the test position. Then you can try it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At first Penny&rsquo;s copy was badly garbled, but under
Billy&rsquo;s enthusiastic coaching she was soon doing accurate
work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, this is fun!&rdquo; she declared. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m coming in
again one of these days and practice. Thanks a lot,
Billy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Penny went back into the editorial room she
saw the Morcrum boy leaving her father&rsquo;s office. His
head was downcast and his face was flushed to the
ears. Obviously, he had not had a comfortable time
with Mr. Parker.</p>
<p>The moment the boy had vanished, Penny hurried
into her father&rsquo;s office to learn the outcome of the
interview.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No luck,&rdquo; reported Mr. Parker, reaching for his
hat and overcoat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He wouldn&rsquo;t change his story?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">[10]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No. He seemed like a fairly decent sort of boy,
but he kept insisting he had been misquoted. I couldn&rsquo;t
get anywhere with him. He&rsquo;ll testify for Maxwell
when the case comes to trial.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Parker put on his overcoat and hat, and opened
the door for Penny. As they left the building he told
her more about the interview.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I asked the boy point-blank if he hadn&rsquo;t been hired
by Maxwell. Naturally, he denied it, but he acted
rather alarmed. Oh, I&rsquo;m satisfied he&rsquo;s either been
bought off or threatened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When does the case come to trial?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The last of next month, unless we gain a delay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That gives you quite a bit of time. Don&rsquo;t you
think you could take two weeks off anyhow, Dad?
We both planned upon having such a wonderful time
at Mrs. Downey&rsquo;s place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny and her father had been invited to spend the
Christmas holidays at Pine Top, a winter resort which
attracted many Riverview persons. They especially
had looked forward to the trip since they were to
have been the house guests of Mrs. Christopher Downey,
an old friend of Mr. Parker&rsquo;s who operated a
skiing lodge on the slopes of the mountain overlooking
Silver Valley.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s not much chance of my getting away,&rdquo;
Mr. Parker replied regretfully. &ldquo;That is, not unless
important evidence falls into my hands, or I am able
to make a deal with Maxwell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A deal?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">[11]</div>
<p>&ldquo;If he would make reasonable demands I might be
willing to settle out of court.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny gazed at her father in blank amazement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And admit you were in the wrong when you&rsquo;re
certain you weren&rsquo;t?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any good general will make a strategic retreat if
the situation calls for it. It might be more sensible to
settle out of court than to lose the case. Maxwell has
me in a tight place and knows it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why don&rsquo;t you see him? He might be fairly
reasonable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose I could stop at the Riverview Hotel on
our way home,&rdquo; Mr. Parker said, frowning thoughtfully.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s an outside chance Maxwell may come
to terms. Drop me off there, Penny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While the car threaded its way in and out of dense
traffic, the editor remained in a deep study. Penny
had never seen him look so worried. Her own disappointment
was keen, yet she realized that far more than
a vacation trip was at stake. Fifty thousand dollars
represented a large sum of money! If Maxwell won
his suit it might even mean the loss of the <i>Riverview
Star</i>.</p>
<p>Sensing his daughter&rsquo;s alarm, Mr. Parker reached
out to pat her knee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re not licked yet,
Penny! And if there&rsquo;s any way to arrange it, you shall
have your trip to Pine Top just as we planned.&rdquo;</p>

<br /><i>A RIVAL REPORTER</i></h2>
<p>Penny presently edged the sedan into a parking
space across the street from the Riverview Hotel.
As she switched off the ignition her father said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better come along with me and wait in the lobby.
It&rsquo;s cold out here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny followed her father into the building. The
hotel was an elegant one with many services available
for guests. She noticed a florist shop, a candy store,
a dry cleaning establishment, and even a small brokerage
office opening off the lobby.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; said Mr. Parker as Penny called his attention
to the brokerage. &ldquo;Maxwell hasn&rsquo;t overlooked
anything. The hotel has a special leased wire which
I&rsquo;ve been told gives him a direct connection with his
other places.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Walking over to the desk, Mr. Parker mentioned his
name and asked the clerk if he might see Harvey
Maxwell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Maxwell is not here,&rdquo; replied the man with
an insolent air.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">[13]</div>
<p>&ldquo;When will he be at the hotel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Maxwell has left the city on business. He does
not expect to return until the end of next month.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Parker could not hide his annoyance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me have his address then,&rdquo; he said in a resigned
voice. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll write him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The clerk shook his head. &ldquo;I have been instructed
not to give you Mr. Maxwell&rsquo;s address. If you wish to
deal with him you will have to see his lawyer, Gorman
S. Railey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So Maxwell was expecting me to come here to
make a deal with him?&rdquo; demanded Mr. Parker. &ldquo;Well,
I&rsquo;ve changed my mind. I&rsquo;ll make a deal all right, but it
will be in court. Good day!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Angrily, the newspaper man strode from the lobby.
Penny hurried to keep pace with him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That settles it,&rdquo; he said tersely as they climbed into
the sedan again. &ldquo;This libel suit will be a fight to the
finish. And maybe my finish at that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Dad, I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll win. But it&rsquo;s a pity all this
had to come up just when you had planned a fine vacation.
Mrs. Downey will be disappointed, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, she will, Penny. And there&rsquo;s Mrs. Weems to
be thought about. I promised her a two weeks&rsquo; trip
while we were gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They drove in silence for a few blocks. As the
car passed the Sidell residence, Penny&rsquo;s father said
thoughtfully:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">[14]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose I could send you out to Pine Top alone,
Penny. Or perhaps you might be able to induce your
chum, Louise, to go along. Would you like that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be more fun if you went also.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s out of the picture now. If everything goes
well I might be able to join you for Christmas weekend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure Louise could go,&rdquo; said Penny doubtfully.
&ldquo;But I can find out right away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After dinner that night, she lost no time in running
over to the Sidell home. At first Louise was thrown
into a state of ecstasy at the thought of making a trip
to Pine Top and then her face became gloomy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would love it, Penny! But it&rsquo;s practically a waste
of words to ask Mother. We&rsquo;re going to my grandmother&rsquo;s
farm in Vermont for the holidays, and I&rsquo;ll
have to tag along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Since grade school days the two girls had been inseparable
friends. Between them there was perfect
understanding and they made an excellent pair, for
Louise exerted a subduing effect upon the more impulsive,
excitable Penny.</p>
<p>Inactivity bored Penny, and wherever she went she
usually managed to start things moving. When nothing
better offered, she tried her hand at writing newspaper
stories for her father&rsquo;s paper. Several of these
reportorial experiences had satisfied even Penny&rsquo;s deep
craving for excitement.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">[15]</div>
<p>Three truly &ldquo;big&rdquo; stories had rolled from her typewriter
through the thundering presses of the <i>Riverview
Star</i>: Tale of the Witch Doll, The Vanishing
Houseboat, and Danger at the Drawbridge. Even now,
months after her last astonishing adventure, friends
liked to tease her about a humorous encounter with a
certain Mr. Kippenberg&rsquo;s alligator.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pine Top won&rsquo;t be any fun without you, Lou,&rdquo;
Penny complained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes it will,&rdquo; contradicted her chum. &ldquo;I know
you&rsquo;ll manage to stir up plenty of excitement. You&rsquo;ll
probably pull a mysterious Eskimo out of a snow bank
or save Santa Claus from being kidnaped! That&rsquo;s the
way you operate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pine Top is an out of the way place, close to the
Canadian border. All one can do there is eat, sleep,
and ski.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean, that&rsquo;s all one is supposed to do,&rdquo; corrected
Louise with a laugh. &ldquo;But you&rsquo;ll run into some
big story or else you&rsquo;re slipping!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t a newspaper within fifty miles. No railroad
either. The only way in and out of the valley is
by airplane, and bob-sled, of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That may cramp your style a little, but I doubt
it,&rdquo; declared Louise. &ldquo;I do wish I could go along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls talked with Mrs. Sidell, but as they both
had expected, it was not practical for Louise to make
the trip.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come to the airport to see you off on your
plane,&rdquo; Louise promised as Penny left the house.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re starting Thursday, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">[16]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, at ten-thirty unless there&rsquo;s bad weather. But
I&rsquo;ll see you again before that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All the next day Penny packed furiously. Mr.
Parker was unusually busy at the office, but he bought
his daughter&rsquo;s ticket and made all arrangements for
the trip to Pine Top. Since Mrs. Weems also planned
to leave Riverview the following day, the house was
in a constant state of turmoil.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel sorry for Dad being left here alone,&rdquo; remarked
Penny. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll never make his bed, and he&rsquo;ll
probably exist on strong coffee and those wretched
raw beef sandwiches they serve at the beanery across
from the <i>Star</i> office.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ought to give up my vacation,&rdquo; declared Mrs.
Weems. &ldquo;It seems selfish of me not to stay here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Parker would not hear of such an arrangement,
and so plans moved forward just as if his own trip had
not been postponed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dad, you&rsquo;ll honestly try to come to Pine Top for
Christmas?&rdquo; Penny pleaded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do my best,&rdquo; he promised soberly. &ldquo;I have a
hunch that Harvey Maxwell may still be in town, despite
what we were told at the hotel. I intend to busy
myself making a complete investigation of the man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I could help, I&rsquo;d be tickled to stay, Dad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing you can do, Penny. Just go out
there and have a nice vacation.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">[17]</div>
<p>Mr. Parker had not intended to go to the office
Thursday morning until after Penny&rsquo;s plane had departed,
but at breakfast time a call came from DeWitt,
the city editor, urging his presence at once. Before
leaving, he gave his daughter her ticket and travelers
checks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I expect to be at the airport to see you off,&rdquo;
he promised. &ldquo;Until then, good-bye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Parker kissed Penny and hastened away. Later,
Louise Sidell came to the house. Soon after ten o&rsquo;clock
the girls took leave of Mrs. Weems, taxiing to the
airport.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see Dad anywhere,&rdquo; Penny remarked as
the cabman unloaded her luggage. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll probably
come dashing up just as the plane takes off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls entered the waiting room and learned that
the plane was &ldquo;on time.&rdquo; Curiously, they glanced at
the other passengers. Two travelers Penny immediately
tagged as business men. But she was rather interested
in a plump, over-painted woman whose nervous manner
suggested that she might be making her first airplane
trip.</p>
<p>While Penny&rsquo;s luggage was being weighed, two
men entered the waiting room. One was a lean, sharp-faced
individual suffering from a bad cold. The other,
struck Penny as being vaguely familiar. He was a stout
man, expensively dressed, and had a surly, condescending
way of speaking to his companion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are those men?&rdquo; Penny whispered to Louise.
&ldquo;Do you know them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Louise shook her head.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">[18]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That one fellow looks like someone I&rsquo;ve seen,&rdquo;
Penny went on thoughtfully. &ldquo;Maybe I saw his picture
in a newspaper, but I can&rsquo;t place him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two men went up to the desk and the portly
one addressed the clerk curtly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have our reservations for Pine Top?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir. Just sign your name here.&rdquo; The clerk
pushed forward paper and a pen.</p>
<p>Paying for the tickets from a large roll of greenbacks,
the two men went over to the opposite side of
the waiting room and sat down. Penny glanced anxiously
at the clock. It was twenty minutes past ten.</p>
<p>A uniformed messenger boy entered the room, letting
in a blast of cold air as he opened the door. He
went over to the desk and the clerk pointed out the
two girls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now what?&rdquo; said Penny in a low voice. &ldquo;Maybe
my trip is called off!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The message was for her, from her father. But it was
less serious than she had expected. Because an important
story had &ldquo;broken&rdquo; it would be impossible for
him to leave the office. He wished her a pleasant trip
west and again promised he would bend every effort
toward visiting Pine Top for Christmas.</p>
<p>Penny folded the message and slipped it into her
purse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dad won&rsquo;t be able to see me off,&rdquo; she explained to
her chum. &ldquo;I was afraid when DeWitt called him this
morning he would be held up.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">[19]</div>
<p>Before Louise could reply the outside door opened
once more, and a girl of perhaps twenty-two who
walked with a long, masculine gait, came in out of the
cold. Penny sat up a bit straighter in her chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you see what I see?&rdquo; she whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is she?&rdquo; inquired Louise curiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The one and only Francine Sellberg.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which means nothing to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me you haven&rsquo;t seen her by-line in the
<i>Riverview Record</i>! Francine would die of mortification.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is she a reporter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She covers special assignments. And she is pretty
good,&rdquo; Penny added honestly. &ldquo;But not quite as good
as she believes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonder what she&rsquo;s doing here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was asking myself that same question.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the two girls watched, they saw Francine&rsquo;s cool
gaze sweep the waiting room. She did not immediately
notice Penny and Louise whose backs were partly
turned to her. Her eyes rested for an instant upon
the two men who previously had bought tickets to
Pine Top, and a flicker of satisfaction showed upon her
face.</p>
<p>Moving directly to the desk she spoke to the ticket
agent in a low voice, yet loudly enough for Penny and
Louise to hear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it still possible to make a reservation for Pine
Top?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">[20]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we have one seat left on the plane.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take it,&rdquo; said Francine.</p>
<p>Penny nudged Louise and whispered in her ear:
&ldquo;Did you hear that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I certainly did. Why do you suppose she&rsquo;s going to
Pine Top? For the skiing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unless I&rsquo;m all tangled in a knot, she&rsquo;s after a big
story for the <i>Record</i>. And I just wonder if those two
mysterious-looking gentlemen aren&rsquo;t the reason for
her trip!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">[21]</div>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">3</span>
<br /><i>TRAVELING COMPANIONS</i></h2>
<p>Francine Sellberg paid for her ticket and
turned so that her gaze fell squarely upon Penny and
Louise. Abruptly, she crossed over to where they sat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, girls,&rdquo; she greeted them breezily. &ldquo;What
brings you to the airport?&rdquo;</p>
<p>As always, the young woman reporter&rsquo;s manner
was brusque and business-like. Without meaning to
offend, she gave others an impression of regarding
them with an air of condescension.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I came to see Penny off,&rdquo; answered Louise before
her chum could speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, are you taking this plane?&rdquo; inquired Francine,
staring at Penny with quickening interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am if it ever gets here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Traveling alone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All by my lonesome,&rdquo; Penny admitted cheerfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re probably only going a short ways?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, quite a distance,&rdquo; returned Penny. She did not
like the way Francine was quizzing her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">[22]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Penny is going to Pine Top for the skiing,&rdquo; declared
Louise, never guessing that her chum preferred
to withhold the information.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pine Top!&rdquo; The smile left Francine&rsquo;s face and her
eyes roved swiftly toward the two men who sat at
the opposite side of the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are to be traveling companions, I believe,&rdquo; remarked
Penny innocently.</p>
<p>Francine&rsquo;s attention came back to the younger girl.
Her eyes narrowed with suspicion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;re going out to Pine Top for the skiing,&rdquo;
she said softly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you?&rdquo; countered Penny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, certainly for the skiing,&rdquo; retorted Francine,
mockery in her voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nice of the <i>Record</i> to give you a vacation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By this time the silver-winged transport had wheeled
into position on the apron, and passengers were beginning
to leave the waiting room. The two men who
had attracted Penny&rsquo;s attention, arose and without appearing
to notice the three girls, went outside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t deceive me one bit, Penny Parker,&rdquo; said
Francine with a quick change of attitude. &ldquo;I know very
well why you are going to Pine Top, and it&rsquo;s for the
same reason I am!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You seem to have divined all my secrets, even when
I don&rsquo;t know them myself,&rdquo; responded Penny. &ldquo;Suppose
you tell me why I am going to Pine Top mountain?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">[23]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s perfectly obvious that your father sent you,
But I am afraid he over-estimates your journalistic
powers if he thinks you have had enough experience
to handle a difficult assignment of this sort. I&rsquo;ll warn
you right now, Penny, don&rsquo;t come to me for help. On
this job we&rsquo;re rivals. And I won&rsquo;t tolerate any bungling
or interference upon your part!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nice to know just where we stand,&rdquo; replied Penny
evenly. &ldquo;Then there will be no misunderstanding or
tears later on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly. And mind you don&rsquo;t give any tip-off as
to who I am!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean you don&rsquo;t care to have those two gentlemen
who were here a moment ago know that you are
a reporter for the <i>Record</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Naturally.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And who are these men of mystery?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As if you don&rsquo;t know!&rdquo; Francine made an impatient
gesture. &ldquo;Oh, why pose, Penny? This innocent
act doesn&rsquo;t go over worth a cent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Louise broke indignantly into the conversation.
&ldquo;Penny isn&rsquo;t posing! It&rsquo;s true she is going to Pine Top
for the skiing and not to get a story. Isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; acknowledged Penny unwillingly. She was
sorry that her chum had put an end to the little game
with Francine.</p>
<p>The reporter stared at the two girls, scarcely knowing
whether or not to believe them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not break down and tell me the identity of
our two fellow passengers?&rdquo; suggested Penny.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">[24]</div>
<p>&ldquo;So you really don&rsquo;t know their names?&rdquo; Francine
flashed a triumphant smile. &ldquo;Fancy that! Well, you&rsquo;ve
proven such a clever little reporter in the past, I&rsquo;ll allow
you to figure it out for yourself. See you in Pine
Top.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Turning away, the young woman went back to the
desk to speak once more with the ticket man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t she simply drip conceit!&rdquo; Louise whispered
in disgust. &ldquo;Did I make a mistake in letting her know
that you weren&rsquo;t on an assignment?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter, Lou. Shall we be going out to
the plane before I miss it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The huge streamliner stood warming up on the
ribbon of cement, long tongues of flame leaping from
the exhausts. Nearly all of the passengers already had
taken their seats in the warm, cozy cabin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-bye, Lou,&rdquo; Penny said, shaking her chum&rsquo;s
hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-bye. Have a nice time. And don&rsquo;t let that
know-it-all Francine get ahead of you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not if I can help it,&rdquo; laughed Penny.</p>
<p>Francine had left the waiting room and was walking
with a brisk step toward the plane. Not wishing
to be the last person aboard, Penny stepped quickly
into the cabin. All but two seats were taken. One was
at the far end of the plane, the other directly behind
the two strange men.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">[25]</div>
<p>Penny slid into the latter chair just as Francine
came into the cabin. As she went down the aisle to
take the only remaining seat, the reporter shot the
younger girl an irritated glance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She thinks I took this place just to spite her!&rdquo;
thought Penny. &ldquo;How silly!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The stewardess, trim in her blue-green uniform, had
closed the heavy metal door. The plane began to move
down the ramp, away from the station&rsquo;s canopied entrance.
Penny leaned close to the window and waved
a last good-bye to Louise.</p>
<p>As the speed of the engines was increased, the plane
raced faster and faster over the smooth runway. A
take-off was not especially thrilling to Penny who
often had made flights with her father. She shook her
head when the stewardess offered her cotton for her
ears, but accepted a magazine.</p>
<p>Penny flipped carelessly through the pages. Finding
no story worth reading, she turned her attention
to her fellow passengers. Beside her, on the right, sat
the over-painted woman, her hands gripping the arm
rests so hard that her knuckles showed white.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&mdash;we&rsquo;re in the air now, aren&rsquo;t we?&rdquo; she asked
nervously, meeting Penny&rsquo;s gaze. &ldquo;I do hope I&rsquo;m not
going to be sick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sure you won&rsquo;t be,&rdquo; replied Penny. &ldquo;The air
is very quiet today.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They tell me flying over the mountains in winter
time is dangerous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not in good weather with a skilful pilot. I am sure
we will be in no danger.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">[26]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Just the same I never would have taken a plane if
it hadn&rsquo;t been the only way of reaching Pine Top.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny turned to regard her companion with new
interest. The woman was in her early forties, though
she had attempted by the lavish use of make-up to
appear younger. Her hair was a bleached yellow, dry
and brittle from too frequent permanent waving. Her
shoes were slightly scuffed, and a tight-fitting black
crepe dress, while expensive, was shiny from long use.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, are you traveling to Pine Top, too?&rdquo; inquired
Penny. &ldquo;Half the passengers on this plane must be
heading for there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that where you are going?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; nodded Penny. &ldquo;I plan to visit an old friend
who has an Inn on the mountain side, and try a little
skiing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is strictly a business trip with me,&rdquo; confided
the woman. She had relaxed now that the transport
was flying at an even keel. &ldquo;I am going there to see
Mr. Balantine&mdash;David Balantine. You&rsquo;ve heard of him,
of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny shook her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear, everyone in the East is familiar with his
name. Mr. Balantine has a large chain of theatres
throughout the country. He produces his own shows,
too. I hope to get a leading part in a new production
which will soon be cast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I see,&rdquo; murmured Penny. &ldquo;You are an actress?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">[27]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been on the stage since I was twelve years
old,&rdquo; the woman answered proudly. &ldquo;You must have
seen my name on the billboards. I am Miss Miller.
Maxine Miller.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should like to see one of your plays,&rdquo; Penny responded
politely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The truth is I&rsquo;ve been &lsquo;at liberty&rsquo; for the past year
or two,&rdquo; the actress admitted with an embarrassed
laugh. &ldquo;&lsquo;At liberty&rsquo; is a word we show people use
when we&rsquo;re temporarily out of work. The movies have
practically ruined the stage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For several weeks I have been trying to get an
interview with Mr. Balantine. His secretaries would
not make an appointment for me. Then quite by luck I
learned that he planned to spend two weeks at Pine
Top. I thought if I could meet him out there in his
more relaxed moments, he might give me a role in
the new production.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it a rather long chance to take?&rdquo; questioned
Penny. &ldquo;To go so far just in the hope of seeing this
man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but I like long chances. And I&rsquo;ve tried every
other way to meet him. If I win the part I&rsquo;ll be well
repaid for my time and money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if you fail?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">[28]</div>
<p>Maxine Miller shrugged. &ldquo;The bread line, perhaps,
or burlesque which would be worse. If I stay at Pine
Top more than a few days I&rsquo;ll never have money
enough to get back here. They tell me Pine Top is
high-priced.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about that,&rdquo; answered Penny.</p>
<p>As the plane winged its way in a northwesterly direction,
the actress kept the conversational ball rolling
at an exhausting pace. She told Penny all about herself,
her trials and triumphs on the stage. As first, it was
fairly interesting, but as Miss Miller repeated herself,
the girl became increasingly bored. She shrewdly
guessed that the actress never had been the outstanding
stage success she visioned herself.</p>
<p>Penny paid more than ordinary attention to the
two men who sat in front of her. However, Miss Miller
kept her so busy answering questions that she could
not have overheard their talk, even if she had made an
effort to do so.</p>
<p>Therefore, when the plane made a brief stop, she
was astonished to have Francine sidle over to her as
she sat on a high stool at the lunch stand, and say in
a cutting tone:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, did you find out everything you wanted to
know? I saw you listening hard enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eavesdropping isn&rsquo;t my method,&rdquo; replied Penny
indignantly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s stupid and is employed only by trash
fiction writers and possibly <i>Record</i> reporters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, are you suggesting&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; interrupted Penny wearily. &ldquo;Now please go
find yourself a roost!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">[29]</div>
<p>Francine ignored the empty stools beside Penny
and went to the far side of the lunch room. A moment
later the two men, who had caused the young woman
reporter such concern, entered and sat down at a
counter near Penny, ordering sandwiches and coffee.</p>
<p>Rather ironically, the girl could not avoid hearing
their conversation, and almost their first words gave
her an unpleasant shock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, Ralph,&rdquo; said the stout one. &ldquo;Nothing
stands in our way now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not forgetting Mrs. Downey&rsquo;s place?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll soon take care of <i>her</i>,&rdquo; the other boasted.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m going out to Pine Top with you,
Ralph. I&rsquo;ll show you how these little affairs are
handled.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">[30]</div>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>

<br /><i>PINE TOP MOUNTAIN</i></h2>
<p>Penny was startled by the remarks of the two men
because she felt certain that the Mrs. Downey under
discussion must be the woman at whose inn she would
spend a two weeks&rsquo; vacation. Was it possible that a
plot was being hatched against her father&rsquo;s friend?
And what did Francine know about it?</p>
<p>She glanced quickly toward the young woman reporter
who was doing battle with a tough steak which
threatened to leap off her plate whenever she tried to
cut it. Apparently, Francine had not heard any part
of the conversation.</p>
<p>Being only human, Penny decided that despite her
recent comments, she could not be expected to abandon
a perfectly good sandwich in the interests of
theoretical honor. She remained at her post and waited
for the men to reveal more.</p>
<p>Unobligingly, they began to talk of the weather
and politics. Penny finished her sandwich, and sliding
down from the stool wandered outdoors.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">[31]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I knew who those men are,&rdquo; she thought.
&ldquo;Francine could tell me if she weren&rsquo;t so horrid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny waited until the last possible minute before
boarding the plane. As she stepped inside the cabin she
was surprised to see that Francine had taken the chair
beside Maxine Miller, very coolly moving Penny&rsquo;s
belongings to the seat at the back of the airliner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you two decide to change places?&rdquo; inquired
the stewardess as Penny hesitated beside the empty
chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t decide. It just seems to be an accomplished
fact.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The stewardess went down the aisle and touched
Francine&rsquo;s arm. &ldquo;Usually the passengers keep their
same seats throughout the journey,&rdquo; she said with a
pleasant smile. &ldquo;Would you mind?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Francine did mind for she had cut her lunch short
in the hope of obtaining the coveted chair, but she
could not refuse to move. Frowning, she went back
to her former place.</p>
<p>Actually, Penny was not particular where she sat.
There was no practical advantage in being directly behind
the two strangers, for their voices were seldom
audible above the roar of the plane. On the other hand,
Miss Miller talked loudly and with scarcely a halt for
breath. Penny was rather relieved when an early stop
for dinner enabled her to gain a slight respite.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">[32]</div>
<p>With flying conditions still favorable, the second
half of the journey was begun. Penny curled up in
her clean, comfortable bed, and the gentle rocking of
the plane soon lulled her to sleep. She did not awaken
until morning when the stewardess came to warn her
they soon would be at their destination. Penny dressed
speedily, and enjoyed a delicious breakfast brought to
her on a tray. She had just finished when Francine
staggered down the aisle, eyes bloodshot, her straight
black hair looking as if it had never been combed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will I be glad to get off this plane!&rdquo; she moaned.
&ldquo;What a night!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t notice anything wrong with it,&rdquo; said
Penny. &ldquo;I take it you didn&rsquo;t sleep well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sleep? I never closed my eyes all night, not with
this roller-coaster sliding down one mountain and up
another. I thought every minute we were going to
crash.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maxine Miller likewise seemed to have spent an uncomfortable
night, for her face was haggard and worn.
She looked five years older and her make-up was
smeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me, do I look too dreadful?&rdquo; she asked Penny
anxiously. &ldquo;I want to appear my best when I meet
Mr. Balantine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have time to rest up before you see him,&rdquo;
the girl replied kindly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long before we reach Pine Top?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We should be approaching there now.&rdquo; Penny
studied the terrain below with deep interest, noting
mountain ranges and beautiful snowy valleys.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">[33]</div>
<p>At last the plane circled and swept down on a small
landing field which had been cleared of snow. Passengers
began to pour from the cabin, grateful that
the long journey was finally at an end.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope I see you again,&rdquo; said Penny, extending her
hand to Miss Miller. &ldquo;And the best of luck with Mr.
Balantine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eagerly, she gathered together her possessions and
stepped out of the plane into blinding sunlight. The
air was crisp and cold, but there was a quality to it
which made her take long, deep breaths. Beyond the
landing field stood a tall row of pine trees, each topped
with a layer of snow like the white icing of a cake.
From somewhere far away she could hear the merry
jingle of sleigh bells.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So this is Pine Top!&rdquo; thought Penny. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s as
pretty as a Christmas card!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A small group of persons were at the field to meet
the plane. Catching sight of a short, sober-looking
little woman who was bundled in furs, Penny hastened
toward her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Downey!&rdquo; she cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Penny, my dear! How glad I am to see you!&rdquo; The
woman clasped her firmly, planting a kiss on either
cheek. &ldquo;But your father shouldn&rsquo;t have disappointed
me. Why didn&rsquo;t he come along?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He wanted to, but he&rsquo;s up to his eyebrows in
trouble. A man is suing him for libel.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">[34]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that <i>is</i> bad,&rdquo; murmured Mrs. Downey. &ldquo;I know
what legal trouble means because I&rsquo;ve had an unpleasant
taste of it myself lately. But come, let&rsquo;s get
your luggage and be starting up the mountain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just a minute,&rdquo; said Penny in a low tone. With a
slight inclination of her head, she indicated the two
male passengers who had made the long journey from
Riverview to Pine Top. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t by any chance
know either of those men?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Downey&rsquo;s face lost its kindliness and she said,
in a grim voice: &ldquo;I certainly do!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before Penny could urge the woman to reveal their
identity, Francine walked over to where she and Mrs.
Downey stood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you wish to see me?&rdquo; inquired the hotel woman
as Francine looked at her with an inquiring gaze.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you Mrs. Downey?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am looking for a place to stay,&rdquo; said Francine. &ldquo;I
was told that you keep an inn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we have a very nice lodge up the mountain
about a mile from here. The rooms are comfortable,
and I do most of the cooking myself. We&rsquo;re located
on the best ski slopes in the valley. But if you&rsquo;re looking
for a place with plenty of style and corresponding
prices you might prefer the Fergus place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your lodge will exactly suit me, I think,&rdquo; declared
Francine. &ldquo;How do I get there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In my bob-sled,&rdquo; offered Mrs. Downey. &ldquo;I may
have a few other guests.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">[35]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t take me a minute to get my luggage,&rdquo;
said Francine, moving away.</p>
<p>Penny was none too pleased to know that the girl
reporter would make her headquarters at the Downey
Inn. Her face must have mirrored her misgiving, for
Mrs. Downey said apologetically:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Business hasn&rsquo;t been any too good this season. I
have to pick up an extra tourist whenever I can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; agreed Penny hastily. &ldquo;One can&rsquo;t run
a hotel without guests.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do believe Jake has snared another victim,&rdquo; Mrs.
Downey laughed. &ldquo;That woman with the bleached
hair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And who is Jake?&rdquo; inquired Penny.</p>
<p>Mrs. Downey nodded her head toward a spry man
with leathery skin who was talking with Maxine
Miller.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He does odd jobs for me at the Inn,&rdquo; she explained.
&ldquo;When he has no other occupation he tries to entice
guests into our den.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You make it sound like a very wicked business,&rdquo;
chuckled Penny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since the Fergus hotel was built it&rsquo;s become a struggle,
to the death,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Downey soberly. &ldquo;I
truly believe this will be my last year at Pine Top.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, you&rsquo;ve had your home here for years,&rdquo; said
Penny in astonishment. &ldquo;You were at Pine Top long
before anyone thought of it as a great skiing resort.
You&rsquo;re an institution here, Mrs. Downey. Surely you
aren&rsquo;t serious about giving up your lodge?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">[36]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I am, Penny. But I shouldn&rsquo;t start telling my
troubles the moment you arrive. I never would have
said a word if you hadn&rsquo;t asked me about those two
men yonder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She gazed scornfully toward the strangers whose
identity Penny hoped to learn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who <i>are</i> they?&rdquo; Penny asked quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The slim fellow with the sharp face is Ralph
Fergus,&rdquo; answered Mrs. Downey, her voice filled with
bitterness. &ldquo;He manages the hotel and is supposed to
be the owner. Actually, the other man is the one who
provides all the money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And who is he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, you should know,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Downey.
&ldquo;He has a hotel in Riverview. His name is Harvey
Maxwell. He only comes here now and then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Harvey Maxwell!&rdquo; repeated Penny. &ldquo;Wait until
Dad hears about this!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your father has had dealings with him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has he?&rdquo; murmured Penny. &ldquo;Maxwell is the man
who is suing Dad for libel!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, of all things!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe I understand why Francine came out here
too,&rdquo; Penny said thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Francine?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">[37]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The girl who just engaged a room at your place.
I think she went to your Inn for the sole purpose of
keeping an eye on me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should she wish to do that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Francine is a reporter for the <i>Riverview Record</i>.
Dad&rsquo;s story about Maxwell bribing a football player
served as a tip-off to other editors. Now the <i>Record</i>
may hope to get evidence against him which they can
build up into a big story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should think that would help your father&rsquo;s case.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It might,&rdquo; agreed Penny, &ldquo;all depending upon how
the evidence was used. But somehow, I don&rsquo;t trust
Francine. If there&rsquo;s any fancy newspaper work to be
done at Pine Top, I aim to look after it myself!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">[38]</div>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">5</span>
<br /><i>OVER THE BARBED WIRE</i></h2>
<p>Mrs. Downey laughed at Penny&rsquo;s remark, not
taking it very seriously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish someone could uncover damaging evidence
against Harvey Maxwell,&rdquo; she declared. &ldquo;But I fear
he&rsquo;s far too clever a man to be caught in anything dishonest.
Sometime when you&rsquo;re in the mood to hear
a tale of woe, I&rsquo;ll tell you how he is running things at
Pine Top.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to learn everything I can about him,&rdquo; responded
Penny eagerly.</p>
<p>Mrs. Downey led the girl across the field to the road
where the bob-sled and team of horses had been
hitched. Jake, the handy man, appeared a moment
later, loaded down with skis and luggage. Maxine
Miller, Francine, and a well-dressed business man soon
arrived and were helped into the sled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is unique taxi service to say the least,&rdquo; declared
Francine, none too well pleased. &ldquo;It must take
ages to get up the mountain.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">[39]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not very long,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Downey cheerfully.</p>
<p>Jake drove, with the hotel woman and her guests
sitting on the floor of the sled, covered by warm
blankets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it always so cold here?&rdquo; shivered Miss Miller.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Always at this time of year,&rdquo; returned Mrs.
Downey. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll not mind it in a day or two. And
the skiing is wonderful. We had six more inches of
snow last night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny thoroughly enjoyed the novel experience of
gliding swiftly over the hard-packed snow. The bobsled
presently passed a large rustic building at the base
of the mountain which Mrs. Downey pointed out as
the Fergus hotel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose all the rich people stay there,&rdquo; commented
Miss Miller. &ldquo;Do you know if they have a
guest named David Balantine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The producer? Yes, I believe he is staying at the
Fergus hotel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the next bend Jake stopped the horses so that
the girls might obtain a view of the valley.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Over to the right is the village of Pine Top,&rdquo; indicated
Mrs. Downey. &ldquo;Just beyond the Fergus hotel
is the site of an old silver mine, abandoned many years
ago. And when we reach the next curve you&rsquo;ll be able
to look north and see into Canada.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">[40]</div>
<p>A short ride on up the mountain brought the party
to the Downey Lodge, a small but comfortable log
building amid the pines. On the summit of a slope not
far away they could see the figure of a skier, poised for
a swift, downward flight.</p>
<p>Mrs. Downey assigned the guests to their rooms,
tactfully establishing Penny and Francine at opposite
ends of a long hall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Luncheon will be served at one o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; she told
them. &ldquo;If you feel equal to it you&rsquo;ll have time for a
bit of skiing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe I&rsquo;ll walk down to the village and send a
wire to Dad,&rdquo; said Penny. &ldquo;Then this afternoon I&rsquo;ll
try my luck on the slopes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just follow the road and you&rsquo;ll not get lost,&rdquo; instructed
Mrs. Downey.</p>
<p>Penny unpacked her suitcase, and then set forth at a
brisk walk for the village. She found the telegraph
station without difficulty and dispatched a message to
her father, telling him of Harvey Maxwell&rsquo;s presence
in Pine Top.</p>
<p>The town itself, consisting of half a dozen stores and
twice as many houses, was soon explored. Before starting
back up the mountain Penny thought she would
buy a morning newspaper. But as she made inquiry at
a drug store, the owner shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t carry them here. The only papers we
get come in by plane. They&rsquo;re all sold out long before
this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I see,&rdquo; said Penny in disappointment, &ldquo;well,
next time I&rsquo;ll try to come earlier.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">[41]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; ventured a voice directly behind
her. &ldquo;Allow me to offer you my paper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny turned around to see that Ralph Fergus had
entered the drugstore in time to hear her remark. With
a most engaging smile, he extended his own newspaper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t like to take your paper,&rdquo; she protested,
wishing to accept no favor however small from the
man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please do,&rdquo; he urged, thrusting it into her hand. &ldquo;I
have finished with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said Penny.</p>
<p>She took the paper and started to leave the store.
Mr. Fergus fell into step with her, following her outside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Going back up the mountain?&rdquo; he inquired casually.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll walk along if you don&rsquo;t mind having company.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny studied Ralph Fergus curiously, fairly certain
he had a special reason for wishing to walk with
her. For a time they trudged along in silence, the snow
creaking beneath their boots.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Staying at the Downey Lodge?&rdquo; Fergus inquired
after awhile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like it there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I only arrived on the morning plane.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">[42]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I noticed you aboard,&rdquo; he nodded. &ldquo;Mrs.
Downey is a very fine woman, a very fine woman, but
her lodge isn&rsquo;t modern. You noticed that, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not especially critical,&rdquo; smiled Penny. &ldquo;It
seemed to suit my needs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be more critical after you have stayed there
a few days,&rdquo; he warned. &ldquo;The service is very poor.
Even this little matter of getting a morning newspaper.
Now our hotel sees that every guest has one shoved
under his door before breakfast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That would be very nice, I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo; remarked
Penny dryly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re the manager of the hotel, aren&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ralph Fergus gave her a quick, appraising glance.
&ldquo;Right you are,&rdquo; he said jovially. &ldquo;Naturally I think
we have the finest hotel at Pine Top and I wish you
would try it. I&rsquo;ll be glad to make you a special rate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re very kind.&rdquo; It was a struggle for Penny to
keep her voice casual. &ldquo;I may drop around sometime
and look the hotel over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do that,&rdquo; he urged. &ldquo;Here is my card. Just ask for
me and I&rsquo;ll show you about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny took the card and dropped it into her pocket.
A few minutes later as they passed the Fergus hotel,
her companion parted company with her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He thought I was an ordinary guest at Mrs.
Downey&rsquo;s,&rdquo; Penny told herself. &ldquo;Otherwise, he never
would have dared to make such an open bid for my
patronage.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">[43]</div>
<p>Upon returning to the lodge she told Mrs. Downey
of her meeting with Ralph Fergus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t surprise me one bit,&rdquo; the woman replied
angrily. &ldquo;Fergus has been using every method he can
think of to get my guests away from me. He has
runners out all the time, talking up his hotel and talking
mine down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny sat on the edge of the kitchen table, watching
Mrs. Downey stir a great kettle of steaming soup.</p>
<p>&ldquo;While I was coming here on the plane I heard
Fergus and Maxwell speaking about you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You did, Penny? What did they have to say?
Nothing good, I&rsquo;ll warrant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t understand what they meant at the
time, but now I think I do. They said that nothing
stood in their way except your place. Maxwell declared
he would soon take care of you, and that he
was on his way to Pine Top to show Fergus how such
affairs were handled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Downey kept on stirring with the big spoon.
&ldquo;So the screws are to be twisted a bit harder?&rdquo; she
asked grimly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do they want your place?&rdquo; Penny inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I take a few of their guests away from
them. If my lodge closed up they could raise prices
sky high, and they would do it, too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They offered me a special rate, whatever that
means.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">[44]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Fergus has been cutting his room rents lately for
the sole purpose of getting my customers away from
me. He makes up for it by charging three and even
four dollars a meal. The guests don&rsquo;t learn that until
after they have moved in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And there&rsquo;s nothing you can do about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Downey shook her head. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been fighting
with my back to the wall this past season. I don&rsquo;t see
how I possibly can make it another year. That is why
I wanted you and your father to visit here before I
gave up the place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dad might have helped you,&rdquo; Penny said regretfully.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry he wasn&rsquo;t able to come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At one o&rsquo;clock Mrs. Downey served a plain but
substantial meal to fourteen guests who tramped in out
of the snow. They called loudly for second and third
helpings which were cheerfully given.</p>
<p>After luncheon Penny sat for a time about the
crackling log fire and then she went to her room and
changed into her skiing clothes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The nursery slopes are at the rear of the lodge,&rdquo;
Mrs. Downey told her as she went out through the
kitchen. &ldquo;But you&rsquo;re much too experienced for them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t been on skis for nearly two years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will come back to you quickly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought I might taxi down and look over the
Fergus hotel.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">[45]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The trail is well marked. Just be careful as you
get about half way down. There is a sharp turn and
if you miss it you may find yourself wrapped around
an evergreen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny went outside, and buckling on her skis,
glided to the top of a long slope which fell rather
sharply through lanes of pine trees to the wide valley
below. As she was studying the course, reflecting that
the crusted snow would be very fast, Francine came
out of the lodge and stood watching her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, Penny?&rdquo; she called. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you
get up your nerve?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny dug in her poles and pushed off. Crouching
low, skis running parallel, she tore down the track.
Pine trees crowded past on either side in a greenish
blur. The wind whistled in her ears. She jabbed her
poles into the snow to check her speed.</p>
<p>After the first steep stretch, the course flattened
out slightly. From a cautious left traverse, a lifted
stem turn gave her time to concentrate her full attention
on the route ahead. She swerved to avoid a
boulder which would have broken her ski had she
crashed into it, and rode out a series of long, undulating
hollows.</p>
<p>Gathering speed again, Penny made her decisions
with lightning rapidity. There was no time to think.
Confronted with a choice of turns, she chose the right
hand trail, slashing through in a beautiful christiana.
Too late, she realized her error.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">[46]</div>
<p>Directly ahead loomed a barbed wire fence. There
was no opportunity to turn aside. Penny knew that
she must jump or take a disastrous fall.</p>
<p>Swinging her poles forward, she let them drop in
the snow close to her ski tips. Crouching low she
sprang upward with all her strength. The sticks gave
her leverage so that she could lift her skis clear of
the snow. Momentum carried her forward over the
fence.</p>
<p>Penny felt the jar of the runners as they slapped on
the snow. Then she lost her balance and tumbled head
over heels.</p>
<p>Untangling herself, she sat up and gazed back at the
barbed wire fence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish all my friends at Riverview could have seen
that jump!&rdquo; she thought proudly. &ldquo;It was a beauty
even if I did land wrong side up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A large painted sign which had been fastened to
the fence, drew her attention. It read: &ldquo;Skiers Keep
Out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder if that means me?&rdquo; remarked Penny
aloud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it means you!&rdquo; said an angry voice behind her.</p>
<p>Penny rolled over in the snow, waving her skis in
the air. She drew in her breath sharply. An old man
with a dark beard had stepped from the shadow of
the pine trees, a gun grasped in his gnarled hands!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">[47]</div>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">6</span>
<br /><i>PENNY TRESPASSES</i></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you understand signs?&rdquo; the old man demanded,
advancing with cat-like tread from the fringe
of pine trees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not when I&rsquo;m traveling down a mountain side at
two hundred miles an hour!&rdquo; Penny replied. &ldquo;Please,
would you mind pointing that cannon in some other
direction? It might go off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man lowered the shotgun, but the grim
lines of his wrinkled, leathery face did not relax.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get up!&rdquo; he commanded, prodding her with the
toe of his heavy boot. &ldquo;Get out of here! I won&rsquo;t have
you or any other skier on my property.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then allow me to make a suggestion,&rdquo; remarked
Penny pleasantly. &ldquo;Put up another strand of barbed
wire and you&rsquo;ll have them all in the hospital!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She sat up, gingerly felt of her left ankle and then
began to brush snow from her jacket. &ldquo;Did you see
me make the jump?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;I took it just like a
reindeer. Or do I mean a gazelle?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">[48]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You made a very awkward jump!&rdquo; he retorted. &ldquo;I
could have done better myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny glanced up with genuine interest. &ldquo;Oh, do
you ski?&rdquo;</p>
<p>By this time she no longer was afraid of the old man,
if indeed she had ever been.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t ski!&rdquo; he answered impatiently. &ldquo;Now
hurry up! Get those skis off and start moving! I&rsquo;ll not
wait all day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny began to unstrap the long hickory runners,
but with no undue show of haste. She glanced curiously
about the snowy field. An old shed stood not
far away. Beside it towered a great stack of wood
which reached nearly as high as the roof. Through
the trees she caught a glimpse of a weather-stained log
cabin with smoke curling lazily from the brick chimney.</p>
<p>As Penny was regarding it, she saw a flash of color
at one of the windows. A girl who might have been
her own age had her face pressed against the pane.
Seeing Penny&rsquo;s gaze upon her, she began to make motions
which could not be understood.</p>
<p>The old man also turned his head to look toward
the cabin. Immediately, the girl disappeared from the
window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that where you live?&rdquo; inquired Penny.</p>
<p>Instead of answering, the old man seized her by
the hand and pulled her to her feet.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">[49]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Go!&rdquo; he commanded. &ldquo;And don&rsquo;t let me catch
you here again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny shouldered her skis and moved toward the
fence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So sorry to have damaged your nice snow,&rdquo; she
apologized. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try not to trespass again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Crawling under the barbed wire fence, Penny retraced
her way up the slope to the point on the trail
where she had taken the wrong turn. There she hesitated
and finally decided to walk on to the Fergus
hotel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder who that girl was at the window?&rdquo; Penny
reflected as she trudged along. &ldquo;She looked too young
to be Old Whisker&rsquo;s daughter. And what was she
trying to tell me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The problem was too deep for her to solve. But
she made up her mind she would ask Mrs. Downey the
name of the queer old man as soon as she returned to
the lodge.</p>
<p>Reaching the Fergus hotel, Penny parked her skis
upright in a snowbank near the front door, and went
inside. She found herself in a long lobby at the end
of which was a great stone fireplace with a half burned
log on the hearth. Bellboys in green uniforms and
brass buttons darted to and fro. A general stir of activity
pervaded the place.</p>
<p>As Penny was gazing about, she saw Maxine Miller
leave an elevator and come slowly across the lobby.
The actress would not have seen her had she not spoken.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">[50]</div>
<p>&ldquo;How do you do, Miss Miller. I didn&rsquo;t expect to
see you here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Miss Parker!&rdquo; The actress&rsquo; face was the picture
of despair. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had the most wretched misfortune!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, what has happened?&rdquo; inquired Penny, although
she thought she knew the answer to her question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just seen Mr. Balantine.&rdquo; Miss Miller sagged
into the depths of a luxuriously upholstered davenport
and leaned her head back against the cushion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your interview didn&rsquo;t turn out as you expected?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He wouldn&rsquo;t give me the part. Hateful old goat!
He even refused to allow me to demonstrate how well
I could read the lines! And he said some very insulting
things to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is too bad,&rdquo; returned Penny sympathetically.
&ldquo;What will you do now? Go back home?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; the woman replied in despair. &ldquo;I
would stay if I thought I could change Mr. Balantine&rsquo;s
opinion. Do you think I could?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t advise it myself. Of course, I don&rsquo;t
know anything about Mr. Balantine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s very temperamental. Perhaps if I kept bothering
him he would finally give me a chance.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">[51]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it might be worth trying,&rdquo; Penny said doubtfully.
&ldquo;But I think if I were you I would return
home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All of my friends will laugh at me. They thought
it was foolish to come out here as it was. I can&rsquo;t go
back. I am inclined to move down to this hotel so
I&rsquo;ll be able to keep in touch with Mr. Balantine with
less difficulty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a very nice looking hotel,&rdquo; commented Penny.
&ldquo;Expensive, I&rsquo;ve been told.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the show business one must keep up appearances
at all cost,&rdquo; replied Miss Miller. &ldquo;I believe I&rsquo;ll
inquire about the rates.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While Penny waited, the actress crossed over to
the desk and talked with a clerk. In a small office close
by, Ralph Fergus and Harvey Maxwell could be seen
in consultation. They were poring over a ledger,
apparently checking business accounts.</p>
<p>Miss Miller returned in a moment. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve taken a
room,&rdquo; she announced. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t afford it, but I am
doing it anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you be able to manage?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ll run up a bill and then let them try to collect!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny gazed at the actress with frank amazement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You surely don&rsquo;t mean you would deliberately
defraud the hotel?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">[52]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not so loud or the clerk will hear you,&rdquo; Miss
Miller warned. &ldquo;And don&rsquo;t use such an ugly word.
If I land the part with Mr. Balantine, of course I&rsquo;ll
pay. If not&mdash;the worst they can do is to throw me
out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny said no more but her opinion of Miss Miller
had descended several notches.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you doing here?&rdquo; the actress inquired,
quickly changing the subject.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I just came down to look over the hotel. It&rsquo;s
very swanky, but I like Mrs. Downey&rsquo;s place better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Miller turned to leave. &ldquo;I am going back there
now to check out,&rdquo; she declared. &ldquo;Would you like
to walk along?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, thank you, I&rsquo;ll just stay here and rest for a few
minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny had no real purpose in coming to the Fergus
hotel. She merely had been curious to see what it was
like. Even a casual inspection made it clear that Mrs.
Downey&rsquo;s modest little lodge never could compete
with such a luxurious establishment.</p>
<p>She studied the faces of the persons in the lobby.
There seemed to be a strange assortment of people,
including a large number of men and women who certainly
had never been drawn to Pine Top by the
skiing. Penny thought whimsically that it would be
interesting to see some of the fat, pampered-looking
ones take a tumble on the slippery slopes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what is the attraction of this place, if not the
skiing?&rdquo; she puzzled. &ldquo;There is no other form of entertainment.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">[53]</div>
<p>Presently, a well-fed lady in rustling black silk,
her hand heavy with diamond rings, paused beside
Penny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;can you tell me
how to find the Green Room?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; replied Penny. &ldquo;I would need a map
to get around in this hotel. You might ask at the
desk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman fluttered over to the clerk and asked
the same question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have your card, Madam?&rdquo; he inquired in a
low tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, to be sure. The manager presented it to
me this morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take the elevator to the second floor wing,&rdquo; the
man instructed. &ldquo;Room 22. Show your card to the
doorman and you will be admitted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny waited until after the woman had gone away.
Then she arose and sauntered across the lobby. She
picked up a handful of hotel literature but there was
no mention of any Green Room. Pausing by the elevator,
she waited until the cage was deserted of passengers
before speaking to the attendant, a red headed
boy of about seventeen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is the Green Room, please?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Second floor, Miss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what is it? A dining room?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The attendant shot her a peculiar glance and gave
an answer which was equally strange.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">[54]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a dining room. I can&rsquo;t tell you what it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A cocktail room perhaps?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen, I told you I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; the boy answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You work here, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure I do,&rdquo; he said with emphasis. &ldquo;And I aim to
keep my job for awhile. If you want to know anything
about the Green Room ask at the desk!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">[55]</div>
<h2 id="c7"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">7</span>
<br /><i>THE GREEN DOOR</i></h2>
<p>Before Penny could ask another question, the
signal board flashed a summons, and the attendant
slammed shut the door of the elevator. He shot the
cage up to the fifth floor and did not return.</p>
<p>Hesitating a moment, Penny wandered over to the
desk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How does one go about obtaining a card for the
Green Room?&rdquo; she inquired casually.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not a guest here?&rdquo; questioned the clerk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to talk with the manager. Oh, Mr.
Fergus!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny had not meant to have the matter go so far,
but there was no retreating. The hotel manager came
out of his office, and recognizing her, smiled ingratiatingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, good afternoon, Miss&mdash;&rdquo; He groped for her
name but Penny did not supply it. &ldquo;So you decided
to pay us a visit after all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This young lady asked about the Green Room,&rdquo;
said the clerk significantly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">[56]</div>
<p>Mr. Fergus bestowed a shrewd, appraising look
upon Penny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; he said to give himself more time, &ldquo;Oh,
yes, I see. What was it you wished to know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How does one obtain a card of admission?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is very simple. That is, if you have the proper
recommendations and bank credit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Recommendations?&rdquo; Penny asked blankly. &ldquo;Just
what is the Green Room anyway?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ralph Fergus and the clerk exchanged a quick
glance which was not lost upon the girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see you are not familiar with the little service
which is offered hotel guests,&rdquo; Mr. Fergus said suavely.
&ldquo;I shall be most happy to explain it to you at some
later time when I am not quite so busy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He bowed and went hurriedly back into the office.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess I shouldn&rsquo;t have inquired about the Green
Room,&rdquo; Penny observed aloud. &ldquo;There seems to be a
deep mystery connected with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No mystery,&rdquo; corrected the clerk. &ldquo;If you will
leave your name and address I am sure everything
can be arranged within a few days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, I don&rsquo;t believe I&rsquo;ll bother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny turned and nearly ran into Francine Sellberg.
Too late, she realized that the girl reporter probably
had been standing by the desk for some time, listening
to her conversation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, Francine,&rdquo; she said carelessly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">[57]</div>
<p>The girl returned a haughty stare. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe
I know you, Miss,&rdquo; she said, and walked on across
the lobby.</p>
<p>Penny was rather stunned by the unexpected snub.
She took a step as if to follow Francine and demand
an explanation, but her sense of humor came to her
rescue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who cares?&rdquo; she asked herself with a shrug. &ldquo;If
she doesn&rsquo;t care to know me, it&rsquo;s perfectly all right. I
can manage to bear up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After Francine had left the hotel, Penny made up
her mind that she would try to learn a little more
about the Green Room. Her interest was steadily
mounting and she could not imagine what &ldquo;service&rdquo;
might be offered guests in this particular part of the
hotel.</p>
<p>Choosing a moment when no one appeared to be
watching, Penny mounted the stairway to the second
floor. She followed a long corridor to its end but did
not locate Room 22. Returning to the elevator, she
started in the opposite direction. The numbers ended
at 20.</p>
<p>While Penny was trying to figure it out, a group
of four men and women came down the hall. They
were well dressed individuals but their manner did
not stamp them as persons of good breeding. One of
the women who carried a jeweled handbag was talking
in a loud, excited tone:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">[58]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Herbert, wait until you see it! I shall weep
my eyes out if you don&rsquo;t agree to buy it for me at
once. And the price! Ridiculously cheap! We&rsquo;ll never
run into bargains like these in New York.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see, Sally,&rdquo; replied the man. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not satisfied
yet that this isn&rsquo;t a flim-flam game.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He opened a door which bore no number, and
stood aside for the others to pass ahead of him. Penny
caught a glimpse of a long, empty hallway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That must be the way to Room 22,&rdquo; she thought.</p>
<p>She waited until the men and women had gone
ahead, and then cautiously opened the door which
had closed behind them. No one questioned her as
she moved noiselessly down the corridor. At its very
end loomed a green painted door, its top edge gracefully
circular. Beside it at a small table sat a man who
evidently was stationed there as a guard.</p>
<p>Penny walked slowly, watching the men and
women ahead. They paused at the table and showed
slips of cardboards. The guard then opened the green
door and allowed them to pass through.</p>
<p>It looked so very easy that Penny decided to try
her luck. She drew closer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your card please,&rdquo; requested the doorman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid I haven&rsquo;t mine with me,&rdquo; said Penny,
flashing her most beguiling smile.</p>
<p>The smile was entirely lost upon the man. &ldquo;Then
I can&rsquo;t let you in,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not even if I have lost my card?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Orders,&rdquo; he answered briefly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have no
trouble getting another.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">[59]</div>
<p>Penny started to turn away, and then asked with
attempted carelessness:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on in there anyway? Are they selling
something?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I really couldn&rsquo;t tell you,&rdquo; he responded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everyone in this hotel seems to be blind, deaf and
dumb,&rdquo; Penny muttered to herself as she retraced her
way to the main hall. &ldquo;And definitely, for a purpose.
I wonder if maybe I haven&rsquo;t stumbled into something?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She still had not the faintest idea what might lie
beyond the Green Door, but the very name had an
intriguing sound. It suggested mystery. It suggested,
too, that Ralph Fergus and his financial backer, Harvey
Maxwell, might have developed some special
money-making scheme which would not bear exposure.</p>
<p>Into Penny&rsquo;s mind leaped a remark which her father
had made, one to the effect that Harvey Maxwell was
thought to have his finger in many dishonest affairs.
The Green Room might be a perfectly legitimate
place of entertainment for hotel guests, but the remarks
she had overheard led Penny to think otherwise.
Something was being sold in Room 22. And to
a very select clientele!</p>
<p>&ldquo;If only I could learn facts which would help Dad&rsquo;s
case!&rdquo; she told herself. &ldquo;Anything showing that Maxwell
is mixed up in a dishonest scheme might turn the
trick!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">[60]</div>
<p>It occurred to Penny that the editor of the <i>Riverview
Record</i> might have had some inkling of a story
to be found at Pine Top. Otherwise, why had Francine
been sent to the mountain resort? Certainly the
rival reporter was working upon an assignment which
concerned Harvey Maxwell. She inadvertently had
revealed that fact at the Riverview airport.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Francine thinks I came here for the same purpose,&rdquo;
mused Penny. &ldquo;If only she weren&rsquo;t so high-hat we
could work together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was almost no real evidence to point to a
conclusion that the Fergus hotel was not being operated
properly. Penny realized only too well that once
more she was depending upon a certain intuition. An
investigation of the Green Room might reveal no
mystery. But at least there was a slender hope she
could learn something which would aid her father in
discrediting Harvey Maxwell.</p>
<p>Without attracting attention, Penny descended to
the main floor and left the hotel. As she retrieved
her skis from the snowbank she was surprised to see
Francine standing close by, obviously waiting for
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, Penny,&rdquo; the girl greeted her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Goodness! Aren&rsquo;t you mistaken? I don&rsquo;t think you
know me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t try to be funny,&rdquo; Francine replied, falling
into step. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll explain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish you would.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">[61]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You should have known better than to shout out
my name there in the lobby.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t follow your reasoning at all, Francine. Are
you traveling incognito or something?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Naturally I don&rsquo;t care to have it advertised that
I am a reporter. I rather imagine you&rsquo;re not overly
anxious to have it known that you are the daughter
of Anthony Parker either!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It probably wouldn&rsquo;t be any particular help,&rdquo; admitted
Penny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly! Despite your play-acting at the airport,
I know you came here to get the low-down on Harvey
Maxwell. But the minute he learns who you are
you&rsquo;ll not even get inside the hotel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that goes double, I take it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one at Pine Top except you knows I am a
reporter,&rdquo; went on Francine without answering. &ldquo;So
I warn you, don&rsquo;t pull another boner like you did a
few minutes ago. Whenever we&rsquo;re around Fergus or
Maxwell or persons who might report to them, just
remember you never saw me before. Is that clear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Moderately so,&rdquo; drawled Penny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess that&rsquo;s all I have to say.&rdquo; Francine hesitated
and started to walk off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a minute, Francine,&rdquo; spoke Penny impulsively.
&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t we bury the hatchet and work
together on this thing? After all I am more interested
in gaining evidence against Maxwell than I am in getting
a big story for the paper. How about it?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">[62]</div>
<p>Francine smiled in a superior way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, I prefer to lone wolf it. You see, I
happen to have a very good lead, and you don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve heard about the Green Room,&rdquo; said
Penny, hazarding a shot in the dark. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Francine stopped short.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you know about it?&rdquo; she demanded
quickly. &ldquo;Maybe we could work together after all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny laughed as she bent down to strap on her
skis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, thanks,&rdquo; she declined pleasantly. &ldquo;You once
suggested that a clever reporter finds his own answers.
You&rsquo;ll have to wait until you read it in the <i>Star</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">[63]</div>

<br /><span class="large">8</span>
<br /><i>A CODED MESSAGE</i></h2>
<p>Penny sat in the kitchen of Mrs. Downey&rsquo;s lodge,
warming her half frozen toes in the oven.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, how did you like the skiing?&rdquo; inquired her
hostess who was busy mixing a huge meat loaf to be
served for dinner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was glorious,&rdquo; answered Penny, &ldquo;only I took a
bad spill. Somehow I missed the turn you told me
about, and found myself heading for a barbed wire
fence. I jumped it and made a one point landing in a
snowbank!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t hurt yourself, thank goodness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but an old man with a shotgun came out of
the woods and said &lsquo;Scat!&rsquo; to me. It seems he doesn&rsquo;t
like skiers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That must have been Peter Jasko.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And who is he, Mrs. Downey?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of the oldest settlers on Pine Top Mountain,&rdquo;
sighed Mrs. Downey. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a very pleasant man in
some respects, but in others&mdash;oh, dear.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">[64]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Skiing must be one of his unpleasant aspects. I
noticed he had a &lsquo;Keep Out&rsquo; sign posted on his property.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peter Jasko is a great trial to me and other persons
on the mountain. He has a hatred of skiing and everything
pertaining to it, which amounts to fanaticism. A
number of skiers have been injured by running into
his barbed wire fence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then he put it up on purpose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes! He has an idea it will keep folks from
skiing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He isn&rsquo;t&mdash;?&rdquo; Penny tapped her forehead significantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; smiled Mrs. Downey. &ldquo;Old Peter is right in
his mind, at least in every respect save this one. He
owns our best ski slopes, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny shifted her foot to a cooler place in the oven.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not the slopes connected with this lodge?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Downey nodded as she whipped eggs to a
foamy yellow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I leased the land from Jasko&rsquo;s son many years ago,
and Jasko can do nothing about it except rage. However,
the lease expires soon. He has given me to understand
it will not be renewed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you deal with the son?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is dead, Penny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I see. That does make it difficult.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Decidedly. Jasko&rsquo;s attitude about the lease is another
reason why I think this will be my last year in
the hotel business.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">[65]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think Ralph Fergus or Harvey Maxwell
have influenced Jasko?&rdquo; Penny asked thoughtfully,
a frown ridging her forehead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I doubt that anyone could influence the old man,&rdquo;
replied Mrs. Downey. &ldquo;Stubborn isn&rsquo;t the word to describe
his character. Even if I lose the ski slopes, I
am quite sure he will never lease them to the Fergus
hotel interests.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;While I was down there I thought I saw a girl
standing at the window of the cabin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably you did, Penny. Jasko has a granddaughter
about your age, named Sara. A very nice girl, too,
but she is kept close at home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel sorry for her if she has to live with that old
man. He seemed like a regular ogre.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Removing her toasted feet from the oven, Penny
pulled on her stiff boots again. Without bothering to
lace them, she hobbled toward the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, by the way,&rdquo; she remarked, pausing. &ldquo;Did
you ever hear of a Green Room at the Fergus hotel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A Green Room?&rdquo; repeated Mrs. Downey. &ldquo;No, I
can&rsquo;t say I have. What is it, Penny?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder myself. Something funny seems to be
going on there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having aroused Mrs. Downey&rsquo;s curiosity, Penny
gave a more complete account of her visit to the
Fergus hotel.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">[66]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never heard anyone mention such a place,&rdquo;
declared the woman in a puzzled voice. &ldquo;But I will
say this. The hotel always has attracted a peculiar
group of guests.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How would you like to have me solve the mystery
for you?&rdquo; joked Penny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would suit me very well indeed,&rdquo; laughed Mrs.
Downey. &ldquo;And while you&rsquo;re about it you might put
Ralph Fergus out of business, and bring me a new
flock of guests.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;re losing one instead. Maxine Miller
told me she is moving down to the big hotel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know. She checked out a half hour ago. Jake
made an extra trip to haul her luggage down the
mountain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyway, I shouldn&rsquo;t be sorry to see her go if I
were you,&rdquo; comforted Penny. &ldquo;I am quite sure she
hasn&rsquo;t enough money to pay for a week&rsquo;s stay at Pine
Top.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Going to her room, Penny changed into more comfortable
clothing and busied herself writing a long
letter to her father. From her desk by the window she
could see skiers trudging up the slopes, some of them
making neat herring-bone tracks, others slipping and
sliding, losing almost as much distance as they gained.</p>
<p>As she watched, Francine swung into view, poling
rhythmically, in perfect timing with her long easy
strides.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She <i>is</i> good,&rdquo; thought Penny, grudgingly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">[67]</div>
<p>Dinner was served at six. Afterwards, the guests
sat before the crackling log fire and bored each other
with tales of their skiing prowess. A few of the more
enterprising ones waxed their skis in preparation for
the next day&rsquo;s sport.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any newspapers tonight?&rdquo; inquired a business man
of Mrs. Downey. &ldquo;Or is this another one of the blank
days?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jake brought New York papers from the village,&rdquo;
replied the hotel woman. &ldquo;They are on the table.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blank days?&rdquo; questioned Francine, looking up
from a magazine she had been reading.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Glasser calls them that when he doesn&rsquo;t get
the daily stock market report,&rdquo; explained Mrs.
Downey, smiling at her guest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And don&rsquo;t the newspapers always arrive?&rdquo; questioned
Francine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not always. Lately the service has been very
poor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather be deprived of a meal than my paper,&rdquo;
growled Mr. Glasser. &ldquo;What annoys me is that the
guests at the Fergus hotel always get their papers. I
wish someone would explain it to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I wish someone would explain it to <i>me</i>,&rdquo;
murmured Mrs. Downey, retreating to the kitchen.</p>
<p>In the morning Penny decided to ski down to the
village for a jar of cold cream. The snow was crusted
and fast but she felt no terror of the trail which
curved sharply through the evergreens. Her balance
was better, and this time she had no intention of impaling
herself on Peter Jasko&rsquo;s barbed wire fence.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">[68]</div>
<p>Seldom checking her speed, she hurtled along the
ribbon of trail. Racing on to the sharp turn, she shifted
her weight and swung her body at precisely the right
instant. The slope stretched on past rows of tall trees,
towering like sentinels along the snow-swept ridges.
Presently it flattened out into an open valley. Penny
sailed past a house, a barn, and gradually slowed up
until she came to a low hillock overlooking the village.</p>
<p>Recapturing her breath, Penny took off her skis
and walked on into Pine Top. She made a few purchases
at the drug store and then impulsively entered
the telegraph office. To her surprise, Francine Sellberg
was there ahead of her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How late is your office open?&rdquo; the reporter was
asking the operator.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Six-thirty,&rdquo; he replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if one has a rush message to send after that
hour?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you can get me at my house,&rdquo; the man answered.
&ldquo;I live over behind the Albert&rsquo;s Filling Station.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; responded Francine, flashing Penny
a mocking smile. &ldquo;I may have an important story to
send to my paper any hour. I wanted to be sure there
would be no delay in getting it off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny waited until the reporter had left the office
and then said apologetically:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose you&rsquo;ve received any message for
me?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">[69]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We always telephone as soon as anything comes
in,&rdquo; the man replied. &ldquo;But wait! You&rsquo;re Penelope
Parker, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In my more serious moments. Otherwise, just plain
Penny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do have something for you, then. A message
came in a few minutes ago. I&rsquo;ve been too busy to telephone
it to the lodge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He handed Penny a sheet of paper which she read
eagerly. As she anticipated, it was from her father,
and with his usual disregard for economy he had not
bothered to omit words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glad to learn you arrived safely at Pine Top,&rdquo; he
had wired. &ldquo;Your information about H. M. is astonishing,
if true. Are you sure it is the same man? Keep
your eye on him, and report to me if you learn anything
worth while. I am held here by important developments,
but will try to come to Pine Top for
Christmas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny read the message twice, scowling at the sentence:
&ldquo;Are you sure it is the same man?&rdquo; It was clear
to her that her father did not have a great deal of faith
in her identification. And obviously, he did not believe
that anything could be gained by making a special
trip to Pine Top to see the hotel man.</p>
<p>Thrusting the paper into the pocket of her jacket
she went out into the cold.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">[70]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No one seems to rate my detective work very
highly,&rdquo; she complained to herself. &ldquo;But when Dad
gets my letter telling him about the Green Door he
may take a different attitude!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Skis slung over her shoulder, she began the weary
climb back to the Downey lodge. Before Penny had
walked very far she saw that she was overtaking a
man on the narrow trail ahead of her. Observing that
it was Ralph Fergus, she immediately slowed her steps.</p>
<p>The hotel man did not turn his head to glance back.
He kept walking slower and slower as if in deep
thought, and after a time he reached absently into his
pocket for a letter.</p>
<p>As he pulled it out, another piece of pale gray paper
fluttered to the ground. Fergus did not notice that he
had lost anything. The wind caught the paper and
blew it down the slope toward Penny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mr. Fergus!&rdquo; she called. &ldquo;You dropped something!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The wind hurled her words back at her. Realizing
that she could not make the man hear, Penny quickened
her pace. After a short chase she rescued the
paper when it caught on the thorns of a snow-caked
bush.</p>
<p>At first glance Penny thought she had gone to trouble
for no purpose. The paper seemed to be blank.
But as she turned it over she saw a single line of
jumbled letters:</p>
<p>YL GFZKY GLULFFLS</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can this be?&rdquo; Penny thought in amazement.
&ldquo;Nothing, I guess.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">[71]</div>
<p>She crumpled the paper and tossed it away. But as
it skittered and bounced like a tumble weed down
the trail, she suddenly changed her mind and darted
after it again. Carefully straightening out the page she
examined it a second time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This looks like copy paper used in a newspaper
office,&rdquo; she told herself. &ldquo;But there is no newspaper in
Pine Top, I wonder&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The conviction came to Penny that the jumbled
letters might be in code. Her pulse leaped at the
thought. If only she were able to decipher it!</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take this to the lodge and work on it,&rdquo; she decided
quickly. &ldquo;Who knows? It may be just the key
I need to unlock this strange affair of the Green
Door!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">[72]</div>
<h2 id="c9"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">9</span>
<br /><i>A CALL FOR HELP</i></h2>
<p>All that afternoon and far into the evening
Penny devoted to her assigned task, trying to make
sense out of the jumbled sentence of typewriting.
She used first one method and then another, but she
could not decode the brief message. She had moments
when she even doubted that it was a code. At last,
completely disgusted, she threw down her pencil and
put the paper away in a bureau drawer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never was meant to be a cryptographer or whatever
you call those brainy fellows who unravel ciphers
and things!&rdquo; she grumbled. &ldquo;Maybe the trouble with
me is that I&rsquo;m not bright.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Switching off the lamp, Penny rolled up the shade,
and stood for a moment gazing down into the dark
valley. Far below she could see lights glowing in the
Fergus hotel, mysterious and challenging.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel as if I&rsquo;m on the verge of an important discovery,
yet nothing happens,&rdquo; she sighed. &ldquo;Something
unusual is going on here, but what?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">[73]</div>
<p>Penny did not believe that Francine knew the answer
either. The girl reporter undoubtedly had been
sent to Pine Top upon a definite tip from her editor,
yet she could not guess the nature of such a tip. It
was fairly evident that Francine was after some sort
of evidence, but so far she had made no progress in
acquiring it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re both groping in the dark, searching for
something we know is here but can&rsquo;t see,&rdquo; thought
Penny. &ldquo;And we watch each other like hawks for fear
the other fellow will get the jump!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Green Door intrigued and puzzled her. While
it might mean nothing at all, she could not shake off
a feeling that if once she were able to get inside the
room she might learn the answer to some of her questions.</p>
<p>Penny had turned over several plans in her mind,
none of which suited her. The most obvious thing to
do was to try to bribe an employee of the hotel to
give her the information she sought. But if she failed,
her identity would be disclosed to Ralph Fergus and
Harvey Maxwell. It seemed wiser to bide her time
and watch.</p>
<p>Penny awoke the next morning to find large flakes
of snow piling on the window sills. The storm continued
and after breakfast only the most rugged skiers
ventured out on the slopes. Francine hugged a hot air
register, complaining that there was not enough heat,
Many of the other guests, soon exhausting the supply
of magazines, became restless.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">[74]</div>
<p>Luncheon was over when Penny stamped in out
of the cold to find Mr. Glasser fretfully pacing to and
fro before the fireplace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When will the papers come?&rdquo; he asked Mrs.
Downey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jake usually goes down to the village after them
about four o&rsquo;clock. But with this thick weather, the
plane may not get in today.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s in now, Mrs. Downey,&rdquo; spoke Penny, shaking
snow from her red mittens. &ldquo;I saw it nearly half an
hour ago, flying low over the valley.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then the papers must be at Pine Top by this time.&rdquo;
Mrs. Downey hesitated before adding: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll call Jake
from his work and ask him to go after them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me,&rdquo; offered Penny quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In this storm?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t mind. I rather like it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, then,&rdquo; agreed Mrs. Downey in relief.
&ldquo;But don&rsquo;t get lost, whatever you do. If the trails become
snowed over it might be better to stay on the
main road.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t get lost,&rdquo; laughed Penny. &ldquo;If worse comes
to worst I always can climb a pine tree and sight the
Fergus hotel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She dried out her mittens, and putting on an extra
sweater beneath her jacket, stepped outside the lodge.
The wind had fallen and only a few snowflakes were
whirling down. Hearing the faint tingle of bells,
Penny turned to gaze toward the road, where a pair
of white horses were pulling an empty lumber wagon
up the hill.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">[75]</div>
<p>The driver, hunched over on the seat, was slapping
his hands together to keep them warm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, that looks like Old Whiskers himself,&rdquo;
thought Penny. &ldquo;It is Peter Jasko.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The observation served only to remind her of their
unpleasant meeting. Since being so discourteously
ejected from the Jasko property Penny had not ventured
back. Knowing that the old man was away she
felt sorely tempted to again visit the locality.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess I ought not to take the time,&rdquo; she decided
regretfully. &ldquo;Mr. Glasser will be fretting for his
paper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Making a quick trip down the mountainside, Penny
swung into the village. Mrs. Downey had told her
that she would be able to get the newspapers at the
Pine Top Cafe where a boy named Benny Smith had
an agency.</p>
<p>Entering the restaurant, she glanced about but saw
no one who was selling papers. Finally, she ventured
to ask the proprietor if she had come to the right
place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the right place,&rdquo; he agreed cheerfully.
&ldquo;Benny went home a little while ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then how do I get the papers for Mrs. Downey&rsquo;s
lodge?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess you&rsquo;re out of luck,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;They
didn&rsquo;t come in today.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">[76]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But I saw the plane.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The plane got through all right. I don&rsquo;t know what
was wrong. Somehow the papers weren&rsquo;t put aboard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny turned away in disappointment. She had
made the long trip to the village for no purpose. While
she did not mind for herself, she knew that Mr. Glasser
and the other guests were likely to be annoyed. After
a day of confinement indoors they looked forward
to news from the outside world.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s strange the papers didn&rsquo;t come,&rdquo; she mused
as she started back to the Downey lodge. &ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t
the first time they&rsquo;ve failed to arrive either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny climbed steadily for a time and then sat down
on a log to rest a moment. She was not far from the
Jasko cabin. By making her own trail through the
woods she could reach it in a very few minutes.</p>
<p>A mischievous idea leaped into her mind, fairly
teasing to be put into effect. What fun to climb the
forbidden barbed wire fence and honeycomb Mr.
Jasko&rsquo;s field with ski tracks! She could visualize his
annoyance when he returned home to learn that a
mysterious skier had paid him a visit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He oughtn&rsquo;t to be so mean,&rdquo; she said aloud to justify
herself. &ldquo;It will serve him right for trying to
frighten folks with shotguns!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny fastened on her skis and glided off through
the woods. She kept her directions straight and soon
emerged into a clearing to find herself in view of the
Jasko cabin. Drawing near the barbed wire fence she
stopped short and stared.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">[77]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, that old scamp! He really did it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A new strand of wire had been added to the fence,
making it many inches higher. Penny&rsquo;s suggestion,
offered as a joke, had been acted upon by Peter Jasko.
Not even an expert ski jumper could hope to clear
the improved barrier. Any person who came unwittingly
down the steep slope must take a disastrous
tumble at the base of the fence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This settles it,&rdquo; thought Penny grimly. &ldquo;My conscience
is perfectly clear now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She rolled under the fence and surveyed the unblemished
expanse of snowy field with the eye of a
mechanical draftsman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I may as well be honest about it and sign my
name,&rdquo; she chuckled.</p>
<p>Starting in at the far corner of the field she made
a huge double-edged &ldquo;P&rdquo; with her long runners. It
took a little ingenuity to figure out an &ldquo;E&rdquo; but two
&ldquo;N&rsquo;s&rdquo; were fairly easy to execute. She finished &ldquo;Y&rdquo;
off with a flourish and cocked her head sideways to
view her handiwork.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not bad, not bad at all,&rdquo; she congratulated herself.
&ldquo;Only I&rsquo;ve used up too much space. We&rsquo;ll have to
have a big Penny and a little Parker.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">[78]</div>
<p>She ran off a &ldquo;P&rdquo; and an &ldquo;A&rdquo; but even her limber
body was not equal to the contortion required for an
&ldquo;R.&rdquo; In the process of making a neat curve she suddenly
lost her balance and toppled over in an ungainly heap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, now I&rsquo;ve done it!&rdquo; she moaned, slowly picking
herself up. &ldquo;All my wonderful artistry gone for
nothing. &lsquo;Parker&rsquo; looks like a big smudge!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A sound, suspiciously suggesting a muffled shout
of laughter, reached Penny&rsquo;s ears. She glanced quickly
about. No one was in sight. The windows of the cabin
were deserted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll be getting out of here,&rdquo; she decided.
&ldquo;If Old Whiskers should come back this wouldn&rsquo;t be
a healthy place to practice handwriting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny dug in her poles and glided toward the fence.
In the act of rolling under the barbed wires, she suddenly
froze motionless. She had heard a cry and this
time there was no doubt in her mind as to the direction
from which the sound had come. Her startled
gaze focused upon the cabin amid the trees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Help! Help!&rdquo; called a shrill, half muffled voice.
&ldquo;Come back, and let me out of my prison!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">[79]</div>
<h2 id="c10"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">10</span>
<br /><i>LOCKED IN THE CABIN</i></h2>
<p>Penny hesitated, and as the call was repeated,
went slowly back toward the cabin. She could see
no one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Up here!&rdquo; shouted the voice.</p>
<p>Glancing toward the second story windows, Penny
saw a girl standing there, her face pressed to the
pane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peter Jasko&rsquo;s granddaughter!&rdquo; thought Penny.
&ldquo;And she must have seen me decorating the place with
ski tracks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>However, the other girl was only concerned with
her own predicament. She smiled and motioned for
Penny to come directly under the window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you help me get out of here?&rdquo; she called
down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not locked in?&rdquo; inquired Penny in astonishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I certainly am! My grandfather did it. He fastened
the door of the loft.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long have you been there?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">[80]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, not very long,&rdquo; the girl answered impatiently,
&ldquo;but I&rsquo;m sick of it! Will you help me out of here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grandfather always hides the key to the outside
door in the woodshed. It should be hanging on a nail
by the window.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny hardly knew what to do. It was one thing
to annoy Peter Jasko by making a few ski tracks in
his yard, but quite another to antagonize him in more
serious ways. For all she could tell, he might have
locked the girl in the cabin as a punishment for some
wrongdoing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does your grandfather often leave you like this?&rdquo;
she asked dubiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Always when there&rsquo;s snow on the ground,&rdquo; came
the surprising answer. &ldquo;Oh, please let me out of this
hateful place! Don&rsquo;t be such a goody-good!&rdquo;</p>
<p>To be accused of being a &ldquo;goody-good&rdquo; was a
novel experience for Penny. But instead of taking offense
she laughed and started toward the woodshed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On a nail by the window!&rdquo; the girl shouted after
her. &ldquo;If it isn&rsquo;t there look on the shelf by the door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny found the key and came back. Taking off
her cumbersome skis, she unlocked the front door and
stepped inside the cabin. The room was rather cold
for the fire had nearly gone out. Despite a bareness
of furniture, the place had a comfortable appearance.
Snowshoes decorated the walls along with a deer
head and an out-dated calendar. There was a cook
stove, a homemade table, chairs, and a cot.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">[81]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Do hurry up!&rdquo; called the impatient voice from
above. &ldquo;Climb the steps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the far end of the room a rickety, crudely constructed
ladder ascended to a rectangular trap door
in the ceiling. Mounting it, Penny investigated the
fastening, a stout plug of wood. She turned it and
pushed up the heavy door. Instantly, it was seized
from above and pulled out of the way.</p>
<p>Head and shoulders through the opening, Penny
glanced about curiously. The room under the roof
certainly did not look like a prison cell. It was snug
and warm, with curtains at the windows and books
lining the wall shelves. The floor was covered with a
bright colored rag rug. There was a comfortable looking
bed, a rocker and even a dressing table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks for letting me out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny turned to gaze at the girl who stood directly
behind her. She was not very pretty, for her nose was
far too blunt and her teeth a trifle uneven. One could
see a faint resemblance to Peter Jasko.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re welcome, I guess,&rdquo; replied Penny, but with
no conviction. &ldquo;I hope your grandfather won&rsquo;t be too
angry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, he won&rsquo;t know about it,&rdquo; the girl answered
carelessly. &ldquo;I see you know who I am&mdash;Sara Jasko.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My name is Penny Parker.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">[82]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I guessed the Penny part. I saw you trying to write
it in the snow. You don&rsquo;t believe in signs either, do
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t have any right to trespass.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t worry about that. Grandfather is an
old fuss-budget. But deep down inside he&rsquo;s rather
nice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did he lock you up here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a long story,&rdquo; sighed Sara. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you about
it later. Come on, let&rsquo;s get out of here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny backed down the ladder. The amazing granddaughter
of Peter Jasko followed, taking the steps as
nimbly as a monkey.</p>
<p>Going to a closet, Sara pulled out a wind-breaker,
woolen cap, and a stub-toed pair of high leather shoes
which she began to lace up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not aiming to run away?&rdquo; Penny asked
uneasily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only for an hour or so. This snow is too beautiful
to waste. But you&rsquo;ll have to help me get back to
my prison.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what this is all about. Suppose you
tell me, Sara.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Grandfather is funny,&rdquo; replied the girl, digging
in the closet again for her woolen gloves. &ldquo;He
doesn&rsquo;t trust me out of his sight when there&rsquo;s snow
on the ground. Today he had to go up the mountain
to get a load of wood so he locked me in.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">[83]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What has snow to do with it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, everything! You must have heard about
Grandfather. He hates skiing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, and you like to ski,&rdquo; said Penny, &ldquo;is that it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I adore it! My father, Bret Jasko, was a champion.&rdquo;
Sara&rsquo;s animated face suddenly became sober. &ldquo;He was
killed on this very mountain. Grandfather never recovered
from the shock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m so sorry,&rdquo; murmured Penny sympathetically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It happened ten years ago while my father was
skiing. Ever since then Grandfather has had an almost
fanatical hatred of the hotel people. And he is
deathly afraid I&rsquo;ll get hurt in some way. He forbids
me to ski even on the easy slopes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you do it anyway?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course. I slip away whenever I can,&rdquo; Sara admitted
cheerfully. &ldquo;Skiing is in my blood. I couldn&rsquo;t
give it up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you don&rsquo;t mind deceiving your grandfather?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t understand. There&rsquo;s no reasoning with
him. Each year he gets a little more set in his ways.
He knows that I slip away to ski, and that&rsquo;s why he
locks me up. Otherwise, Grandfather is a dear. He&rsquo;s
taken care of me since my father died.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sara wriggled into her awkward-fitting coat,
wrapped a red scarf about her throat and started for
the door.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">[84]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Coming, Penny?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t promised yet that I will help you get
back into your cubby-hole.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you will,&rdquo; said Sara confidently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose so,&rdquo; sighed Penny. &ldquo;Nevertheless, I don&rsquo;t
particularly like this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They stepped out of the cabin into the blinding
sunlight. The storm had stopped, but the wind blew a
gust of snow from the roof into their faces.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My skis are hidden in the woods,&rdquo; said Sara. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
walk along the fence so my footprints won&rsquo;t be so
noticeable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The place is pretty well marked up now,&rdquo; Penny
observed dryly. &ldquo;Your grandfather would have to be
blind not to see them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but they&rsquo;re your tracks, not mine,&rdquo; grinned
Sara. &ldquo;Besides, this strong wind is starting to drift the
snow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They followed the barbed wire fence to the woods.
Sara went straight to an old log and from its hollow
interior drew out a pair of hickory jumping skis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s walk up to Mrs. Downey&rsquo;s lodge,&rdquo; she proposed.
&ldquo;Her chute is a dandy, but most of the guests
are afraid to use it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t tried it myself,&rdquo; admitted Penny. &ldquo;It
looks higher than Pike&rsquo;s Peak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you have plenty of nerve,&rdquo; returned Sara
carelessly. &ldquo;I saw you take Grandfather&rsquo;s barbed wire
entanglements.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">[85]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That was a matter of necessity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing ventured, nothing gained,&rdquo; laughed Sara,
linking arms with Penny and pulling her along at a
fast pace. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll teach you a few tricks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They climbed the slope steadily until forced to
pause for a moment to catch their breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Downey isn&rsquo;t using the bob-sled run this
year, is she?&rdquo; Sara inquired curiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know anything about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She has a fine one on her property, but it&rsquo;s out of
sight from the lodge. I guess there haven&rsquo;t been enough
guests this season to make it worth while. Too bad.
Bob-sled racing is even more fun than skiing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Coming within view of the Downey lodge, Penny
observed that a few of the more hardy guests had
taken advantage of the lull in the storm, and were
out on the slopes, falling, picking themselves up, falling
again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have to run into the house a minute,&rdquo; Penny
excused herself. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be right back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She found Mrs. Downey in the kitchen and reported
to her that she had been unable to purchase
papers in the village.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The plane came in, didn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but for some reason the papers weren&rsquo;t put
on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder if the Fergus hotel managed to get any?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how they could.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s happened before,&rdquo; declared Mrs. Downey.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">[86]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Time after time we miss our papers, and then I
learn later that the Fergus hotel guests had them. I
don&rsquo;t understand it, Penny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall I tell Mr. Glasser?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do it,&rdquo; sighed Mrs. Downey. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s going to
be more irritated than ever now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny went outside to find Sara waiting impatiently
for her. The girl had strapped on her skis, and
was using two sharp-pointed sticks for poles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ready to try the jump, Penny?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but I&rsquo;ll watch you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing to it, Penny,&rdquo; encouraged Sara
as they climbed side by side. &ldquo;Just keep relaxed and
be sure to have your skis pointing upward while
you&rsquo;re in the air.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As it became evident that the girls intended to try
the chute, a little crowd of spectators gathered on the
slope below to watch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go first,&rdquo; said Sara, &ldquo;and after I&rsquo;ve landed, you
come after me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll think it over,&rdquo; shivered Penny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think too long, or you&rsquo;ll never try it. Just
start.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sara bent to examine her bindings. Then in a graceful
crouch she shot down the hill and with a lifting
of her arms soared over the take-off. She made a perfectly
poised figure in mid-air and an effortless landing
on the slope below, finishing off with a christiana
turn.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">[87]</div>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s <i>good</i>!&rdquo; thought Penny. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try it, too, even
if they carry me off on a stretcher!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a wave of enthusiasm she pushed off, keeping
her arms behind her. As the edge of the chute loomed
up, she swung them forward and sprang into the air.
But something went wrong. In an instant she was off
balance, her arms swinging wildly in a futile attempt
to straighten her body into position.</p>
<p>The gully appeared to be miles below her. Panic
surged over Penny and her muscles became rigid.
She was going to take a hard fall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Relax! Relax!&rdquo; screamed a shrill voice.</p>
<p>With a supreme effort Penny drew back one ski
and bent her knees. She felt a hard jar, and in amazement
realized that she had landed on her feet. Her
elation was short lived, for the next instant she collapsed
and went sliding on down the slope.</p>
<p>Sara ran to help her up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a bit,&rdquo; laughed Penny. &ldquo;What a spectacle I
must have made!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your jump wasn&rsquo;t half bad. Next time you&rsquo;ll do
much better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never make one as good as yours,&rdquo; Penny said
enviously. Seeing Francine standing near, she turned
to the reporter and exclaimed: &ldquo;Did you watch Sara&rsquo;s
jump? Wasn&rsquo;t it magnificent?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re both lucky you weren&rsquo;t injured.&rdquo; Francine
walked over to the two girls. She stared at Sara&rsquo;s
odd looking costume. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not a guest here?&rdquo; she
inquired.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">[88]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered Sara.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor at the Fergus hotel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I live a ways down the mountain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Francine regarded her coldly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re the Jasko
girl, aren&rsquo;t you, whose grandfather will not allow
skiers on his property?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since you Jaskos are so sign conscious I should
think you might obey them yourself! Take a glance
at that one over on the tree. Unless my eyesight is
failing it reads: &lsquo;Only guests of the hotel may use
these slopes.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">[89]</div>
<h2 id="c11"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">11</span>
<br /><i>A NEWSPAPER MYSTERY</i></h2>
<p>Penny stared at Francine, for a moment not believing
that she had meant the remark seriously. As she
comprehended that the girl indeed was serious, she
exclaimed in quick protest:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Francine, what an attitude to take! Sara is
my guest. I&rsquo;m sure Mrs. Downey doesn&rsquo;t mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go,&rdquo; offered Sara in a quiet voice. &ldquo;I never
dreamed I would offend anyone by being here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not particularly offended,&rdquo; replied Francine
defensively. &ldquo;It merely seems reasonable to me that
if you won&rsquo;t allow others on your property you
shouldn&rsquo;t trespass yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sara had nothing to do with that sign on her
grandfather&rsquo;s land,&rdquo; declared Penny. &ldquo;Francine, you
must have jumped out of the wrong side of the bed
this morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sara had turned to walk away. Penny caught her
hand, trying to detain her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait, I&rsquo;ll run into the lodge and ask Mrs. Downey.
But I know very well it will be all right for you to
stay.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">[90]</div>
<p>Sara hesitated, and might have consented, save at
that instant the three girls heard the faint tinkle of
bells. A sled loaded with wood came into view around
a curve of the mountain road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s grandfather on his way home!&rdquo; exclaimed
Sara. &ldquo;I must get back there before he learns I&rsquo;ve
been away! Hurry, Penny!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With several quick thrusts of her sticks, she started
down the trail which led to the Jasko cabin. Penny
followed, but she could not overtake her companion.
Sara skied with a reckless skill which defied imitation.
While Penny was forced to stem, she took the
rough track with no perceptible slackening of speed,
and had divested herself of skis by the time her companion
reached the woods.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to work fast,&rdquo; she warned, hiding the
long runners in the hollow log. &ldquo;I want you to lock
me in the cabin and then get away before Grandfather
sees you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about our tracks in the snow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll blame them all on you,&rdquo; laughed Sara, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
beginning to get dark now. And Grandfather is near
sighted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like this business at all,&rdquo; complained Penny
as they kept close to the fence on their way to the
cabin. &ldquo;Why not tell your grandfather&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He would rage for days and never let me out
again. No, this is the best way. And you&rsquo;ll come back
soon, won&rsquo;t you, Penny?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">[91]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like to promise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll teach you how to jump.&rdquo; Sara offered attractive
bait.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see. I&rsquo;ll think it over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, promise!&rdquo; persisted Sara. &ldquo;Say you&rsquo;ll come
back and at least talk to me through the window.
You have no idea how lonesome I get.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; Penny suddenly gave in. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do that
much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Reaching the cabin, Sara had Penny tramp about
in the snow with her skis so as to give the impression
that a visitor had walked several times around the
building but had not entered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to lock me in the loft,&rdquo; she instructed.
&ldquo;Then take the key back to the woodshed and get
away as quickly as you can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sara pulled off her garments and hung them in the
closet. With a mop she wiped up tracks which had
been made on the bare floor. Then she climbed up
the ladder to her room.</p>
<p>Penny turned the wooden peg, and retreating from
the cabin, locked the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget!&rdquo; Sara called to her from the window.
&ldquo;Come again soon&mdash;tomorrow if you can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hiding the key in the woodshed, Penny tramped
about the outside of the building several times before
gliding off toward the boundary fence. As she began
a tedious climb up the trail toward the Downey lodge,
she saw the sled appear around a bend of the road.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">[92]</div>
<p>Penny did not visit the Jasko cabin the following
day nor the next. Along with other guests she was
kept indoors by a raging snow and sleet storm which
blocked the road and disrupted telephone service to
the village.</p>
<p>Everyone at the Downey lodge suffered from the
confinement, but some accepted the situation more
philosophically than others. As usual Mr. Glasser
complained because there were no daily papers. Penny
overheard him telling another guest he was thinking
very seriously of moving to the Fergus hotel where
at least a certain amount of entertainment was provided.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll leave,&rdquo; Mrs. Downey observed resignedly
when the conversation was repeated to her. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen
it coming for days. Mr. Glasser has been talking with
one of the runners for the Fergus hotel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s unfair of them to try to take your guests
away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, they&rsquo;re determined to put me out of business
at any cost. Miss Sellberg is leaving, too. She served
notice this morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny glanced up with quick interest. &ldquo;Francine?
Is she leaving Pine Top?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, she told me she had decided to move to the
Fergus hotel because of its better location.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">[93]</div>
<p>Penny nodded thoughtfully. She could understand
that if Francine were trying to gain special information
about either Ralph Fergus or Harvey Maxwell,
it would be to her advantage to have a room at the
other hotel. Had it not been for her loyalty to Mrs.
Downey, she, too, would have been tempted to take
up headquarters there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t really blame folks for leaving,&rdquo; Mrs. Downey
continued after a moment. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve not offered very
much entertainment this year. Last season in addition
to skiing we had the bob-sled run.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I met Sara Jasko and she was telling me about it,&rdquo;
replied Penny. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you use the run again this
year?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We could, but it scarcely seems worth the trouble
and expense. Also, it takes experienced drivers to
steer the sleds. The young man I had working for me
last winter isn&rsquo;t available at present.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there no other person at Pine Top who could
do it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sara Jasko,&rdquo; responded Mrs. Downey, smiling.
&ldquo;However, it&rsquo;s not likely her grandfather would give
his consent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The following day dawned bright and clear and
brought a revival of spirit at the Downey lodge.
Nevertheless, with the roads open once more, both
Francine and Mr. Glasser moved their belongings
down to the Fergus hotel. As was to be expected,
their departure caused a certain amount of comment
by the other guests.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">[94]</div>
<p>Late in the afternoon Penny offered to ski down
to Pine Top for the newspapers. She planned to stop
at the Fergus hotel upon her return, hoping to learn
a little more about the mysterious Green Room which
had intrigued her interest.</p>
<p>Reaching the village, Penny located Benny Smith,
but the lad shook his head when she inquired for the
daily papers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have any today.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the plane came through! I saw it myself about
an hour ago. This makes four days since we&rsquo;ve had a
newspaper at the lodge. What happened?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy glared at Penny almost defiantly. &ldquo;You
can&rsquo;t blame me. It&rsquo;s not my fault if they&rsquo;re not put
on the plane.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, of course not. I didn&rsquo;t mean to suggest that
you were at fault. It&rsquo;s just queer that we miss our
papers so often. And we never seem to get the back
editions either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know anything about it,&rdquo; the boy
muttered.</p>
<p>Penny stood watching him slouch off down the
street. Something about the lad&rsquo;s manner made her
wonder if he had not lied. She suddenly was convinced
that Benny knew more about the missing
newspapers than he cared to tell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how would he profit by not receiving them?&rdquo;
she mused. &ldquo;He would lose sales. It simply doesn&rsquo;t
make sense.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">[95]</div>
<p>As she trudged on down the street Penny turned
the problem over in her mind. She walked with head
bent low and did not notice an approaching pedestrian
until she had bumped into him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; apologized the man politely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was my fault,&rdquo; replied Penny. She glanced up
to see that the stranger was no stranger at all, but the
airplane pilot who had brought her to Pine Top
several days before.</p>
<p>He would have passed on had she not halted him
with a question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder if you could tell me what seems to be
the trouble with the newspaper delivery service here
at Pine Top?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We couldn&rsquo;t get through yesterday on account of
the weather,&rdquo; he returned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what happened to the papers today?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean they came through?&rdquo; Penny asked in
surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. You can get them from Benny
Smith.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From Benny? But he said&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny started to reveal that the boy had blamed
the failure of service upon the pilot, and then changed
her mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; she returned, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll talk with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny was more puzzled than ever, but she had no
reason to doubt the pilot&rsquo;s word. Obviously, the newspapers
had arrived at Pine Top, and Benny Smith
knew what had become of them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">[96]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just investigate this matter a little further,&rdquo;
Penny decided as she left the village.</p>
<p>Approaching the Fergus hotel a few minutes later,
she paused to catch her breath before going inside.
In the gathering twilight the building looked more
than ever like a great Swiss chalet. The pitched roof
was burdened with a thick layer of white snow, and
long icicles hung from the window ledges.</p>
<p>Inside the crowded, smoke-filled lobby there was
an air of gaiety. A few lights had been turned on,
and the orchestra could be heard tuning up in the
dining room.</p>
<p>Penny saw no one that she knew. Crossing quickly
to a counter at the far side of the lobby, she spoke
to a girl who was in charge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can I buy a newspaper here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we have them.&rdquo; The girl reached around a
corner of the counter, indicating a stack of papers
which Penny had not seen. &ldquo;New York Times?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will do very nicely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny paid for the paper and carrying it over to
a chair, quickly looked at the dateline.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s today&rsquo;s issue, all right,&rdquo; she told herself grimly.
&ldquo;This proves what I suspected. Ralph Fergus has been
buying up all the papers&mdash;a little trick to annoy Mrs.
Downey and get her in bad with her guests!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">[97]</div>
<h2 id="c12"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">12</span>
<br /><i>THE GREEN CARD</i></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Do you always talk to yourself?&rdquo; inquired an
amused voice from behind Penny.</p>
<p>Glancing up from the newspaper, the girl saw
Maxine Miller standing beside her chair. For an instant
she failed to recognize the actress, so elegant did
the woman appear in a sealskin coat and matching
hat. The outfit was so new that the fur had lost none
of its glaze, an observation which caused Penny to
wonder if Miss Miller had misled her regarding the
state of her finances.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good evening, Miss Miller,&rdquo; she smiled. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t
know you for a moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you like it?&rdquo; inquired the actress, turning
slowly about.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your new fur coat? It&rsquo;s very beautiful. And you&rsquo;re
looking well, too. You didn&rsquo;t by chance get that role
from David Balantine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Miller&rsquo;s painted lips drew into a pout. &ldquo;No, he
left the hotel this morning.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">[98]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s too bad. I suppose you&rsquo;ll be going soon,
then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The actress shook her head, and laughed in a mysterious
way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;ve decided to stay here for awhile. I like
Pine Top.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny was puzzled by Miss Miller&rsquo;s sudden change
in manner and appearance. The woman acted as if
she were the possessor of an important secret which
she longed to reveal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must have fallen heiress to a vast fortune,&rdquo;
Penny ventured lightly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better than that,&rdquo; beamed Miss Miller. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve acquired
a new job. Take dinner with me and I&rsquo;ll tell
you all about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;&rdquo; Penny deliberated and said honestly, &ldquo;I
didn&rsquo;t bring very much money with me, and I&rsquo;m not
dressed up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Miller brushed aside both objections as if they
were of no consequence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be my guest, dearie. And your clothes don&rsquo;t
matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She caught Penny&rsquo;s hand and pulled her to her feet.
Her curiosity aroused, the girl allowed herself to be
escorted to the dining room.</p>
<p>Miss Miller walked ahead, strutting a bit as she
brushed past the crowded tables. Heads lifted and
envious feminine eyes focused upon the actress&rsquo; stunning
fur coat. Penny felt awkward and embarrassed,
clomping along behind in her big heavy ski boots.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">[99]</div>
<p>The head waiter gave them a choice table near the
orchestra. Miss Miller threw back her coat, exposing
a form-fitting black satin gown with a brilliant blue
stone pin at the neck line. She knew that she was
creating an impression and thoroughly enjoyed herself.</p>
<p>A waiter brought menu cards. The actress proceeded
to order for both herself and Penny. She selected
the most expensive dishes offered, stumbling
over their long French names.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How nice it is to have money again,&rdquo; she remarked
languidly when the waiter had gone. &ldquo;Do you really
like my new wardrobe, dearie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, I do, Miss Miller. Your dress is very becoming,
and the fur coat is stunning. Isn&rsquo;t it new?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly two days old.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you must have acquired it since coming to
Pine Top. I had no idea such lovely skins could be
bought anywhere near here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re very close to the Canadian border, you
know.&rdquo; Again the actress flashed her mysterious smile.
&ldquo;But the duty is frightful unless one is able to avoid
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny gazed thoughtfully across the table at her
companion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And do you know how to avoid it?&rdquo; she asked as
casually as she could manage.</p>
<p>Miss Miller steered skilfully away from the subject.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">[100]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, this coat was given to me. It didn&rsquo;t cost me a
cent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how does one go about acquiring a free coat?
You&rsquo;ve not become a professional model?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; the actress denied, &ldquo;but your guess is fairly
warm. I do have a nice figure for displaying clothes.
No doubt that was why I was given the job.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is your employer, Miss Miller? Someone
connected with the hotel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The waiter had brought a loaded tray to the table,
and the actress used his arrival as a pretext for not
answering Penny&rsquo;s question. After the man went away
she began to chat glibly about other subjects. However,
with the serving of dessert, she once more
switched to the topic of her wardrobe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were asking me about my fur coat, dearie,&rdquo;
she said. &ldquo;Would you like to have one like it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who wouldn&rsquo;t? What must I do to acquire one&mdash;rob
a bank?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Miller laughed in a forced way. &ldquo;You will
have your little joke. From what you&rsquo;ve told me, I
imagine your father has plenty of money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t remember saying anything about it,&rdquo; responded
Penny dryly. &ldquo;As a matter of fact, my father
isn&rsquo;t wealthy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At least your family is comfortably fixed or you
wouldn&rsquo;t be at this expensive winter resort,&rdquo; Miss
Miller went on, undisturbed. &ldquo;Now would you be
able to pay as much as a hundred dollars for a coat?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">[101]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I hadn&rsquo;t even thought of buying one,&rdquo; replied
Penny, trying not to disclose her astonishment. &ldquo;Can
you really get a good fur coat for as little as a hundred
dollars?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You could through my friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your friend?&rdquo; asked Penny bluntly. &ldquo;Do you
mean your new employer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, yes,&rdquo; the actress admitted with a self-conscious
laugh. &ldquo;He is a fur salesman. You&rsquo;ve been
very nice to me and I might be able to get a coat for
you at cost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s most kind,&rdquo; remarked Penny dryly.
&ldquo;Where could I see these coats?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My employer has a salesroom here at the hotel,&rdquo;
Miss Miller declared. &ldquo;I can arrange an appointment
for you. Say tomorrow at two?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t enough money with me to buy a coat
even if I wanted one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if you liked the furs you could wire your parents
for more,&rdquo; the actress wheedled. &ldquo;It is a wonderful
opportunity. You&rsquo;ll never have another chance to
buy a beautiful coat at cost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to think it over,&rdquo; Penny returned. &ldquo;I
suppose you get a commission on every garment
sold?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A small one. In your case, I&rsquo;ll not take it. I truly
am interested in seeing you get your coat, dearie. You
have just the figure for it, you&rsquo;re so slim and svelte.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">[102]</div>
<p>Penny was not deceived by the flattery. She knew
very well that the actress had treated her to dinner
for the purpose of making her feel under obligation
and as a build-up to the suggestion that she purchase
a fur coat.</p>
<p>Glancing at the bill she was relieved to see that she
had enough money to pay for her share of the meal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, I won&rsquo;t hear of it,&rdquo; Miss Miller protested
grandly.</p>
<p>Summoning the waiter, she gave him a twenty dollar
bill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me know if you decide you would like to see
the coats,&rdquo; she said to Penny as they left the dining
room together. &ldquo;It won&rsquo;t cost you anything to look,
you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll think it over. Thanks for the dinner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny looked about the crowded lobby for Ralph
Fergus or Harvey Maxwell, but neither man was to
be seen. While at the hotel she would have liked to
acquire a little more information about the Green
Room. With the actress hovering at her elbow it was
out of the question.</p>
<p>She considered speaking of the matter to Miss
Miller, and then abandoned the idea. However, it had
occurred to her that the mysterious room of the hotel
might have some connection with the actress&rsquo; present
employment, and so she ventured one rather direct
question.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">[103]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Miller, you&rsquo;re not by chance working for
Ralph Fergus or the hotel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear me, no!&rdquo; the actress denied. &ldquo;Whatever put
such an idea in your head?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It just occurred to me. Well, good-bye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny left the hotel and ventured out into the cold.
After so much cigarette smoke, the pure air was a
pleasant relief. She broke off a long icicle from the
doorway, and stood thoughtfully chewing at it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Miller must be working for some dishonest
outfit,&rdquo; she mused. &ldquo;Her talk about getting a fur coat
at cost doesn&rsquo;t fool me one bit. If I were in her shoes
I&rsquo;d be more than a little worried lest I tangled with
the law.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A remark by the actress to the effect that the Canadian
border was close by had set Penny&rsquo;s active
mind to working. It was not too fantastic to believe
that Miss Miller might be employed by an unscrupulous
man whose business concerned the sale of furs
obtained duty free. She had even dared hope that
Ralph Fergus or Harvey Maxwell might be implicated
in the dishonest affair. What a break that would be
for her father if only she could prove such a connection!
But the actress&rsquo; outright denial that either
man was her employer had put an end to such pleasant
speculation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">[104]</div>
<p>Penny bent down to pick up her skis which had
been left at the side of the hotel building. As she
leaned over, she noticed a small object lying on top
of the snow in the square of light made from one of
the windows. It appeared to be a small piece of colored
cardboard.</p>
<p>Curiously, Penny picked it up and carried it closer
to the window. The card was green. Her pulse quickened
as she turned it over. On its face were six engraved
words:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Admit Bearer Through The Green Door.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">[105]</div>

<br /><span class="large">13</span>
<br /><i>AN UNKIND TRICK</i></h2>
<p>Penny all but executed a clog dance in the snow.
She knew that she had picked up an admittance ticket
to the Green Room of the Fergus hotel which some
person had lost. With no effort upon her part she
would be able to learn the answer to many of the
questions which had plagued her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At last I&rsquo;ll find out what lies behind that Green
Door,&rdquo; she thought in high elation. &ldquo;If this isn&rsquo;t the
most wonderful piece of luck!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Debating a moment, Penny decided that it probably
was too late to gain admittance that evening.
Mrs. Downey no doubt was worried over her long
absence from the lodge. She would return there, and
then revisit the hotel early the next day.</p>
<p>Pocketing the precious ticket, Penny set off up the
mountain. It was dark before she had covered half the
distance, but there were stars and a half moon to
guide her.</p>
<p>Mrs. Downey showed her relief as the girl stomped
into the kitchen.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">[106]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I was beginning to worry, Penny,&rdquo; she declared.
&ldquo;Whatever made it take you so long?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I stopped at the Fergus hotel and had dinner with
Miss Miller.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Were you able to get the newspapers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only one which I had to buy at the Fergus hotel.
Mrs. Downey, it&rsquo;s queer about those papers. Benny
Smith told me there weren&rsquo;t any to be had, and then
a few minutes later I met the airplane pilot who told
me he had brought them in the same as usual. Also,
the Fergus hotel received its usual quota.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s odd.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks to me as if the Fergus outfit has made some
arrangement with the paper boy. They may be buying
up all the papers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As a means of annoying me,&rdquo; nodded Mrs. Downey
grimly. &ldquo;It would be in line with their tactics.
But what can I do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; admitted Penny. She pulled off her
heavy boots and set them where they would dry. &ldquo;We
haven&rsquo;t any proof they&rsquo;re doing anything like that.
It&rsquo;s only my idea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The door opened and Jake came into the kitchen.
He dropped an armload of wood behind the range.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I started work on the bob-sled run this afternoon,&rdquo;
he remarked to Mrs. Downey. &ldquo;Got a crew of boys
coming first thing tomorrow. We ought to have her
fixed up by noon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the sleds?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">[107]</div>
<p>&ldquo;They seem to be in good condition, but I&rsquo;ll check
everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After the workman had gone, Penny glanced questioningly
at Mrs. Downey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you decided to use the run after all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I started thinking about it after we talked together.
We do need more entertainment here at the
lodge. After you left I ordered Jake to start work on
the track. But I still am in need of experienced drivers
for the sled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You spoke of Sara.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought I would ask her, but I doubt if her
Grandfather will give his consent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll ski down there tomorrow and talk with her if
you would like me to,&rdquo; offered Penny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would appreciate it,&rdquo; said Mrs. Downey gratefully.
&ldquo;I hate to spare the time myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Early the next morning Penny paid a visit to the
bob-sled run where a crew headed by Jake was hard
at work. There was a stretch of straightaway and a
series of curves which snaked down the valley between
the pines. At the point of the steepest curve, the
outer snow walls rose to a height of eighteen feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A sled could really travel on that track,&rdquo; observed
Penny. &ldquo;Does it hurt to upset?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It might,&rdquo; grinned Jake. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve never had an
upset on Horseshoe Curve. If a sled went over there,
you might wake up in the hospital.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">[108]</div>
<p>Penny watched the men packing snow for awhile.
Then buckling on her skis, she made a fast trip down
the mountain to the Jasko cabin. This time, having a
definite mission, she went boldly to the door and
rapped.</p>
<p>There was no response until the window of the
loft shot up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, Penny,&rdquo; called down Sara. &ldquo;I thought you
had forgotten your promise. The key&rsquo;s in the same
place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t your grandfather here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, he went down to Pine Top. Isn&rsquo;t it glorious
skiing weather? Hurry and get the key. I&rsquo;ve been
cooped up here half an hour already.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny went reluctantly to the woodshed and returned
with the key. She unfastened the trapdoor
which gave entrance to the loft and Sara quickly descended.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t your grandfather say anything about last
time?&rdquo; Penny inquired anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, he raved because someone had trespassed. But
it never occurred to him I had gone away. Where
shall we ski today?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I only stopped to deliver a message, Sara. I am on
my way down to the Fergus hotel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said the girl in disappointment. &ldquo;A message
from whom?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Downey. She is starting up her bob-sled run
again and she wants you to help out.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">[109]</div>
<p>Sara&rsquo;s eyes began to sparkle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I could! If only Grandfather weren&rsquo;t so
strict.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there a chance he&rsquo;ll give his consent?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear, no. But I might be able to slip away.
Grandfather plans to chop wood every day this
week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I doubt if Mrs. Downey would want you to do
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Need you tell her?&rdquo; queried Sara coolly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll fix
myself a rope ladder and get out the window. That
will save you the trouble of coming here to let me in
and out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what will your grandfather say if he learns
about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Plenty! But anything is better than being shut up
like a prisoner. You tell Mrs. Downey I&rsquo;ll try to get
up to the lodge tomorrow morning, and we&rsquo;ll try out
the track together, eh Penny?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know anything about bob-sledding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll teach you to be my brake boy,&rdquo; Sara laughed.
&ldquo;How long will you stay at the Fergus hotel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t any idea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I suppose I&rsquo;ll have to crawl back into my
cave,&rdquo; Sara sighed dismally. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you even ski with
me for half an hour?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not this morning,&rdquo; Penny said firmly. &ldquo;I have
important work ahead.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">[110]</div>
<p>She shooed Sara back into the loft and returned the
key to the woodshed. The Jasko girl watched from
the window, playfully shaking her fist as her friend
skied away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sara is as stimulating as a mountain avalanche,&rdquo;
chuckled Penny, &ldquo;but she&rsquo;s almost too headstrong.
Sooner or later her stunts will involve me in trouble
with Peter Jasko.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the valley below, smoke curled lazily from the
chimneys of the Fergus hotel. Making directly for it,
Penny felt in her pocket to be certain she had not lost
the green ticket which she had found the previous
evening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is going to be my lucky day,&rdquo; she told herself
cheerfully. &ldquo;I feel it in my bones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Reaching the hotel, Penny stripped off her skis and
entered the hotel lobby. Maxine Miller was not in
evidence nor did she see any other person who likely
would question her presence there. She did notice
Harvey Maxwell sitting in the private office. His eyes
were upon her as she crossed the room. However,
Penny felt no uneasiness, realizing that if he noticed
her at all he recognized her only as a guest at the
Downey lodge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Second floor,&rdquo; she said quietly to the elevator boy.</p>
<p>Penny was the sole passenger, but as she stepped
from the cage, she was dismayed to run directly into
Francine Sellberg.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">[111]</div>
<p>The reporter greeted her with a suspicious stare.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, hello, Penny Parker. What are you doing
here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, just moseying around.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can see you are!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your room isn&rsquo;t on this floor, is it?&rdquo; Penny inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, on the fourth,&rdquo; Francine answered before she
considered her words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looking for someone?&rdquo; remarked Penny with a
grin. &ldquo;Or should I say <i>something</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>An elevator stopped at the landing. &ldquo;Going down,&rdquo;
the attendant called, opening the door. He gazed questioningly
at the two girls.</p>
<p>Francine shook her head, although she had been
waiting for an elevator. Turning again to Penny she
said with a hard smile: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve not only been looking
for something, I&rsquo;ve found it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Still, I don&rsquo;t see you rushing to reach a telephone,
Francine. Your discovery can&rsquo;t have such tremendous
news value.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may have before long,&rdquo; hinted Francine. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
mind telling you I am on the trail of a really big story.
And I am making steady progress in assembling my
facts.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">[112]</div>
<p>Penny regarded the girl reporter speculatively. Her
presence on the second floor rather suggested that she,
too, had been trying to investigate the Green Room,
and more than likely had learned its location. But she
was reasonably certain Francine had gathered no information
of great value.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glad to hear you&rsquo;re doing so well,&rdquo; she remarked
and started on down the hall.</p>
<p>Francine fell into step with her. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re looking
for a particular room, Penny, maybe I can help you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny knew that the reporter meant to stay with
her so that she could do no investigation work of her
own.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The room I am searching for has a green door,&rdquo;
she replied.</p>
<p>Francine laughed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;re so honest,
Penny. I guessed why you were on this floor all the
time. However, I greatly fear you&rsquo;re in the wrong
part of the hotel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny paused and turned to face her companion
squarely. &ldquo;Why not put an end to all this nonsense,
Francine? We watch each other and get nowhere.
Let&rsquo;s put our cards on the table.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yours might be a joker!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re both interested in getting a story which
will discredit Harvey Maxwell,&rdquo; Penny went on, ignoring
the jibe. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve had a tip as to what may be
going on here, while I&rsquo;m working in the dark. On the
other hand, I&rsquo;ve acquired something which should
interest you. Why don&rsquo;t we pool our interests and
work together?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That would be very nice&mdash;for you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">[113]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I think I might contribute something to the case.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I doubt it,&rdquo; replied Francine loftily. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t
even know the location of the Green Room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re wrong about that. It took no great detective
power to learn it&rsquo;s on this floor. To get inside may
be a different matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re quite right there,&rdquo; said Francine with emphasis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you say? Shall we work together and let
bygones be bygones?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Penny, I prefer to work alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suit yourself, Francine. I was only trying to be
generous. You see, I have an admittance card to the
Green Room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Flashing a gay smile, Penny held up the ticket for
Francine to see.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you get it?&rdquo; the reporter gasped. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
tried&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A little bird dropped it on my window sill. Too
bad you didn&rsquo;t decide to work with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny walked on down the corridor, and Francine
made no attempt to follow. When she glanced back
over her shoulder the reporter had descended the
stairway to the lobby.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was boastful of me to show her my ticket,&rdquo; she
thought. &ldquo;But I couldn&rsquo;t resist doing it. Francine is
so conceited.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">[114]</div>
<p>Making her way to the unmarked door of the
wing, Penny paused there a moment, listening. Hearing
no sound she pushed open the door and went
down the narrow hall. The guard sat at his usual post
before the Green Door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good morning,&rdquo; said Penny pleasantly. &ldquo;I have
my card now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man examined it and handed it back. &ldquo;Go right
in,&rdquo; he told her.</p>
<p>Before Penny could obey, the door at the end of
the corridor swung open. Harvey Maxwell, his face
convulsed with rage, came hurrying toward the
startled girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just learned who you are,&rdquo; he said angrily.
&ldquo;Kindly leave this hotel at once, and don&rsquo;t come
back!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">[115]</div>
<h2 id="c14"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">14</span>
<br /><i>A BROKEN ROD</i></h2>
<p>&ldquo;You must have mistaken me for some other person,&rdquo;
Penny stammered, backing a step away from the
hotel man. &ldquo;Who do you think I am?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The question was a mistake, for it only served to
intensify Harvey Maxwell&rsquo;s anger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the daughter of Anthony Parker who runs
the yellowest paper in Riverview! I know why he
sent you here. Now get out and don&rsquo;t let me catch
you in the hotel ever again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Observing the green card in Penny&rsquo;s hand he
reached out and jerked it from her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t doing any harm,&rdquo; she said, trying to act
injured. &ldquo;My father didn&rsquo;t send me to Pine Top. I
came for the skiing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Secretly, Penny was angry at Maxwell&rsquo;s reference
to the <i>Riverview Star</i> as being a &ldquo;yellow&rdquo; sheet, which
in newspaper jargon meant that it was a sensation-seeking
newspaper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what are you doing in this part of the hotel?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">[116]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I only wanted to see the Green Room,&rdquo; Penny
replied. &ldquo;I thought I would have my breakfast here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Harvey Maxwell and the doorman exchanged a
quick glance which was not lost upon the girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did you get your ticket?&rdquo; the hotel man
demanded but in a less harsh voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I picked it up outside the hotel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny spoke truthfully and her words carried conviction.
Harvey Maxwell seemed satisfied that she
had not been investigating the wing for any special
purpose. However, he took her by an elbow and
steered her down the corridor to the elevator.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re the smart little girl I think you are, a
hint will be sufficient,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want any
member of the Parker family on my premises. So stay
away. Get me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; responded Penny meekly.</p>
<p>Inwardly, she was raging. Someone deliberately had
betrayed her to Harvey Maxwell and she had a very
good idea who that person might be. From now on
employes of the hotel would be told to keep watch
for her. Never again would she be allowed in the
lobby, much less in the vicinity of the Green Room.</p>
<p>Harvey Maxwell walked with Penny to the front
door of the hotel and closed it behind her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remember,&rdquo; he warned, &ldquo;stay away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Penny started down the walk she heard a silvery
laugh, and glancing sideways, saw Francine leaning
against the building.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">[117]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t spend much time in the Green Room,
did you?&rdquo; she inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was a dirty trick to play!&rdquo; retorted Penny.
&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t have done it to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t have thought that fast, my dear
Penny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I might tell Mr. Maxwell you&rsquo;re a reporter for the
<i>Riverview Record</i>. How would you like that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Francine shrugged. &ldquo;In that case we both lose the
story. All I want is an exclusive. After the yarn breaks
in the <i>Record</i>, your father will be welcome to make
use of any information published. So if you really
want him to win his libel suit, you&rsquo;ll gain by not interfering
with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You reason in a very strange way,&rdquo; replied Penny
coldly.</p>
<p>Picking up her skis she shouldered them and
marched stiffly away. She was angry at Francine and
angry at herself for having given the rival reporter an
opportunity to score against her. Probably she would
never tell Harvey Maxwell or Ralph Fergus who the
girl actually was, sorely as she might be tempted. As
Francine had pointed out, her own chance of gleaning
any worth while information had been lost.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a bitter pill to choke down,&rdquo; thought Penny,
&ldquo;but I would rather have the <i>Record</i> get the story than
to lose it altogether.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">[118]</div>
<p>Sunk deep in depression, she tramped back to the
Downey lodge. The mail had arrived during her absence
but there was no letter from home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dad might at least send me a postcard,&rdquo; she grumbled.
&ldquo;For two cents I would take the next plane back
to Riverview.&rdquo;</p>
<p>However, Penny could not remain downhearted for
any great length of time. Why worry about Francine
and the silly old Green Room? She would forget all
about it and try to have fun for a change.</p>
<p>It was not difficult to dismiss the matter from her
mind, for the following morning Sara Jasko came to
give her a lesson in bob-sled driving. With a crowd of
interested guests watching from the sidelines, they
made their first exciting ride over the track. Sara
steered, Jake operated the brake, and Penny rode as
sole passenger.</p>
<p>Horseshoe Curve was the most thrilling point on the
course. As the sled tore around it at a tremendous rate
of speed, Jake dug in the iron claw of the brake, sending
up a plume of snow. They slackened speed perceptibly,
but even so the sled climbed high on the
sloping wall, and Penny thought for an anxious moment
that they were going over the top. The remainder
of the run was mild by comparison.</p>
<p>Upon later trips Penny was allowed to manage the
brake, and soon became dexterous in applying it as
Sara shouted the command.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">[119]</div>
<p>Skiers abandoned the slopes to watch the new sport.
Two at a time, Penny and Sara gave them rides and
all of their passengers were enthusiastic.</p>
<p>By the following day the word had spread down
the mountain that Mrs. Downey&rsquo;s bob-sled run was
operating. Guests from the Fergus hotel joined the
throng but they were given rides only when there
were no passengers waiting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s going over like a house afire!&rdquo; Penny declared
gaily to Mrs. Downey. &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if
you take some of the Fergus hotel&rsquo;s customers away
from them if this enthusiasm lasts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You and Sara are showing folks a wonderful time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we&rsquo;re having one ourselves. It&rsquo;s even more
fun than skiing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But more dangerous,&rdquo; declared Mrs. Downey. &ldquo;I
hope we have no accidents.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sara is a skillful driver.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, she is,&rdquo; agreed Mrs. Downey. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no
cause for worry so long as the track isn&rsquo;t icy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two days passed during which Penny did not even
go near the Fergus hotel or to the village. As she remarked
to Mrs. Downey, all of Pine Top came to the
lodge. During the morning hours when the bob-sled
run was in operation, a long line of passengers stood
waiting. Guests from the Fergus hotel had few chances
for rides. Several of them, wishing to be on the favored
list, checked out and came to take lodging at
Mrs. Downey&rsquo;s place.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">[120]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t understand it,&rdquo; the woman declared to
Penny. &ldquo;Last year the run wasn&rsquo;t very popular. I
think it may have been because we had a little accident
at the beginning of the season. Nothing serious
but it served to frighten folks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder how the Fergus-Maxwell interests are
enjoying it?&rdquo; chuckled Penny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not very well, you may be sure. This flurry in
our business will rather worry them. They may not
put me out of business as quickly as they expected.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At least you&rsquo;ll end your season in a blaze of glory,&rdquo;
laughed Penny.</p>
<p>The weather had turned warmer. Late Thursday
afternoon the snow melted a bit and the lowering
night temperatures caused a film of ice to form over
the entire length of the bob-sled run. Jake shook his
head as he talked over the situation with Penny the
next morning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The track will be fast and slippery this morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A lot of folks will be disappointed if we don&rsquo;t
make any trips,&rdquo; declared Penny. &ldquo;Here comes Sara.
Let&rsquo;s see what she has to say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sara studied the run, and walked down as far as
Horseshoe Curve.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fast all right,&rdquo; she conceded. &ldquo;But that will only
make it the more exciting. Brakes in good order,
Jake?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tested every sled last night after they were
brought to the shop.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">[121]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ll have no trouble,&rdquo; said Sara confidently.
&ldquo;Round up the passengers, Jake, and we&rsquo;ll start at
once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sled was hauled to the starting line. Sara took
her place behind the wheel, with Penny riding the end
position to handle the brake. Their first passengers
were to be a middle aged married couple. Sara gave
them padded helmets to wear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are these for?&rdquo; the woman asked nervously.
&ldquo;The toboggan slide isn&rsquo;t dangerous, is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, certainly not,&rdquo; answered Sara. &ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t
had a spill this year. Hang tight on the curves. Give
me plenty of brake when I call for it, Penny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She signaled for the push off. They started fast and
gathered speed on the straightaway. Penny wondered
how Sara could steer for her own eyes blurred as they
shot down the icy trough. They never had traveled
at such high speed before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brakes!&rdquo; shouted Sara.</p>
<p>Penny obeyed the order, and felt the sled slow
down as the brake claw dug into the snow and ice.
They raced on toward the first wide curve, and swung
around it, high on the banked wall, too close to the
outside edge for comfort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brakes!&rdquo; called Sara again.</p>
<p>Once more the iron claw dug in, sending up a
spray of snow behind the racing sled. And then there
came a strange, pinging sound.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">[122]</div>
<p>For the briefest instant Penny did not comprehend
its significance. Then, as the sled leaped ahead faster
than ever and the geyser of snow vanished, she realized
what had happened. The brakes were useless!
A rod had snapped! They were roaring down the
track with undiminished speed, and Horseshoe Curve,
the most dangerous point on the run, lay directly
ahead.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">[123]</div>
<h2 id="c15"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">15</span>
<br /><i>IN THE TOOL HOUSE</i></h2>
<p>Sara, her face white and tense, turned her head for
a fraction of a second and then, crouching lower, kept
her eyes glued on the track. She knew what had happened,
and she knew, too, that they never could hope
to make the Horseshoe Curve. Even a miracle of steering
would not save them from going over the wall of
ice at terrific speed.</p>
<p>The two passengers, frozen with fright, gripped
the side ropes, and kept their heads down. It did not
even occur to them that they could save themselves
by rolling off. For that matter, they did not realize
that the brake had broken.</p>
<p>Penny, in end position, could have jumped easily,
A fall into the soft snow beside the track would be
far less apt to cause serious injury than an upset from
the high wall of the curve. But it never occurred to
her to try to save herself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">[124]</div>
<p>There was only one slim chance of preventing a
bad accident, a costly one for herself, and Penny took
it. As the perpendicular wall of Horseshoe Curve
loomed up ahead, she wrapped her arm about the
side rope of the sled and hurled herself off. Her entire
body was given a violent jerk. A sharp pain shot
through her right arm, but she gritted her teeth and
held on.</p>
<p><a href="#front">Penny&rsquo;s trailing body, acting as a brake, slowed
down the sled</a> and kept it from upsetting as it swept
into the curve. Sideways it climbed the wall of snow.
It crept to the very edge, hovered there a breathless
moment, then fell back to overturn at the flat side of
the curve.</p>
<p>Untangling herself from a pile of arms and legs,
Sara began to help her passengers to their feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Penny, are you hurt?&rdquo; she asked anxiously. &ldquo;That
was a courageous thing to do! You saved us from a
bad accident.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Spectators, thrilled by the display of heroism, came
running to the scene. Penny, every muscle screaming
with pain, rolled over in the snow. Gripping her
wrenched arm, she tried to get to her feet and could
not.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Penny, you <i>are</i> hurt!&rdquo; cried Sara.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s my arm, more than anything else,&rdquo; Penny said,
trying to keep her face from twisting. &ldquo;I&mdash;I hope it&rsquo;s
not broken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Willing hands raised her to her feet and supported
her. Penny was relieved to discover that she could lift
her injured arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only wrenched,&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;Anyone else
hurt, Sara?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">[125]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the only casualty,&rdquo; Sara replied warmly.
&ldquo;But if you hadn&rsquo;t used yourself as a brake we might
all have been badly injured. You ought to get a hot
bath as quickly as you can before your muscles begin
to stiffen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve begun already,&rdquo; replied Penny ruefully.</p>
<p>She took a step as if to start for the lodge, only to
hesitate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder what happened to the brake? I heard
something give way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sara overturned the sled and took one glance. &ldquo;A
broken rod.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought Jake checked over everything last night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what he <i>said</i>,&rdquo; returned Sara. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll ask
him about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The workman, white-faced and frightened, came
running down the hill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What happened?&rdquo; he demanded. &ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t you
slow down or was it too icy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No brakes,&rdquo; Sara answered laconically. &ldquo;I thought
you tested them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did. They were in good order last night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take a look at this.&rdquo; Sara pointed to the broken
rod.</p>
<p>Jake bent down to examine it. When he straightened
he spoke no word, but the expression of his face
told the two girls that he did not hold himself responsible
for the mishap.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">[126]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s something funny about this,&rdquo; he muttered.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take the sled to the shop and have a look at it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go along with you,&rdquo; declared Sara.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so will I,&rdquo; added Penny quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You really should get a hot bath and go to bed,&rdquo;
advised Sara. &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t you may not be able to
walk tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go to bed in a little while,&rdquo; Penny answered
significantly.</p>
<p>Followed by the two girls, Jake pulled the sled to
the tool house behind the lodge. Sara immediately
closed and bolted the door from the inside so that
curious persons would not enter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now let&rsquo;s really have a look at that brake rod,&rdquo; she
said. &ldquo;Notice anything queer about it, Penny?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did, and I&rsquo;m thinking the same thing you are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;See these shiny marks on the steel,&rdquo; Jake pointed
out excitedly. &ldquo;The rod had been sawed almost in
two. Even a little strain on it would make it break.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re certain it was in good condition last night?&rdquo;
Sara questioned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Positive,&rdquo; Jake responded grimly. &ldquo;I checked over
both sleds just before supper last night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s have a look at the other sled,&rdquo; proposed
Penny.</p>
<p>An inspection of the brake equipment revealed
nothing out of order.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">[127]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Whoever did the trick may have been afraid to
damage both sleds for fear of drawing attention to his
criminal work,&rdquo; declared Penny. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s perfectly
evident someone wanted us to take a bad spill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t guess who would try such a trick,&rdquo; said
Sara in perplexity. &ldquo;Did you lock the tool house last
night, Jake?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I always do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about the windows?&rdquo; inquired Penny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t rightly remember,&rdquo; Jake confessed. &ldquo;I
reckon they&rsquo;re stuck fast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny went over and tested one of the windows.
While it was not locked, she could not raise it with
her injured arm. Sara tried without any better luck.</p>
<p>However, as the girls examined the one on the opposite
side of the tool house, they discovered that it
raised and lowered readily. Tiny pieces of wood were
chipped from the outside sill, showing where a blunt
instrument had been inserted beneath the sash.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is where the person entered, all right,&rdquo; declared
Penny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t understand who would wish to injure us,&rdquo;
said Sara in a baffled voice. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not known here
at Pine Top, and I have no enemies to my knowledge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Downey has them. There are persons who
would like to see her out of business. And our bob-sledding
parties were growing popular.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They were taking a few guests away from the big
hotel,&rdquo; Sara admitted slowly. &ldquo;Still, it doesn&rsquo;t seem
possible&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">[128]</div>
<p>She broke off as Penny reached down to pick up a
small object which lay on the floor beneath the window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What have you found?&rdquo; she finished quickly.</p>
<p>Penny held out a large black button for her to see.
A few strands of coarse dark thread still clung to the
eyelets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks like a button from a man&rsquo;s overcoat!&rdquo; exclaimed
Sara. &ldquo;Jake, does this belong to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The workman glanced at it and shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It probably fell from the coat of the person who
damaged our sled,&rdquo; Penny declared thoughtfully.
&ldquo;Not much of a clue, perhaps, but at least it&rsquo;s something
to go on!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">[129]</div>
<h2 id="c16"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">16</span>
<br /><i>A PUZZLING SOLUTION</i></h2>
<p>Penny pocketed the button and then with Sara
went outside the building to look for additional clues.
The girls found only a multitude of footprints in the
snow beneath the two windows, for the tool house
stood beside a direct path to the nursery slopes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve learned everything we&rsquo;re going to,&rdquo; declared
Sara. &ldquo;Penny, I do wish you would get into the
house and take your bath. You&rsquo;re limping worse every
minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, I&rsquo;ll go. I do feel miserable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you ought to have a doctor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny laughed in amusement. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be brake man on
the bob-sled tomorrow as usual.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be lucky if you&rsquo;re able to crawl out of bed.
Anyway, I doubt if I&rsquo;ll be able to come myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your grandfather?&rdquo; asked Penny quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he&rsquo;s getting suspicious. I&rsquo;ll have to be more
careful.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">[130]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you tell him the truth? It&rsquo;s really not
fair to deceive him. He&rsquo;s bound to learn the truth
sooner or later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid to tell him,&rdquo; Sara said with a little shiver.
&ldquo;When grandfather is angry you can&rsquo;t reason with
him. I&rsquo;ll have to run now. I&rsquo;m later than usual.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny watched her friend go and then hobbled
into the lodge. News of the accident had preceded
her, and Mrs. Downey met her at the door. She was
deeply troubled until she ascertained for herself that
the girl had not been seriously injured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was afraid something like this would happen,&rdquo;
Mrs. Downey murmured self accusingly. &ldquo;You know
now why I wasn&rsquo;t very enthusiastic about using the
bob-sled run.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny decided not to tell Mrs. Downey until later
how the mishap had occurred. She was feeling too
miserable to do much talking, and she knew the truth
would only add to the woman&rsquo;s worries.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;m so thrilled about it myself at the
moment,&rdquo; she declared with a grimace. &ldquo;I feel as stiff
as if I were mounted on a mummy board!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Downey drew a tub of hot water, but it required
all of Penny&rsquo;s athletic prowess to get herself
in and out of it. Her right arm was swollen and painful
to lift. The skin on one side of her body from hip
to ankle had been severely scraped and bruised. She
could turn her neck only with difficulty.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">[131]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I do think I should call a doctor from the village,&rdquo;
Mrs. Downey declared as she aided the girl
into bed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please, don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; pleaded Penny. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be as frisky as
ever by tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Downey lowered the shades and went away.
Left alone, Penny tried to go to sleep, but she was too
uncomfortable. Every time she shifted to a new position
wracking pains shot through her body.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If this isn&rsquo;t the worst break,&rdquo; she thought, sinking
deep into gloom. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be crippled for several days at
least. No skiing, no bob-sledding. And while I&rsquo;m lying
here on my bed of pain, Francine will learn all about
the Green Room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After awhile the warmth of the bed overcame
Penny and she slept. She awakened to find Mrs.
Downey standing beside her, a tray in her hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t have disturbed you,&rdquo; the woman apologized,
&ldquo;but you&rsquo;ve been sleeping so long. And you&rsquo;ve
had nothing to eat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could do with a little luncheon,&rdquo; mumbled Penny
drowsily. &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t need to bother bringing it upstairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is dinner, not luncheon,&rdquo; corrected Mrs.
Downey.</p>
<p>Penny rolled over and painfully pulled herself to a
sitting posture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I must have slept hours! What time is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Five-thirty. Do you feel better, Penny?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">[132]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I think I do. From my eyebrows up anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While Penny ate her dinner, Mrs. Downey sat beside
her and chatted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At least there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with my appetite,&rdquo;
the girl laughed, rapidly emptying the dishes. &ldquo;At
home Mrs. Weems says I eat like a wolf. Oh, by the
way, any mail?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny&rsquo;s face clouded. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s funny no one writes me.
Don&rsquo;t you think I might at least get an advertising
circular?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Christmas is coming,&rdquo; Mrs. Downey said
reasonably. &ldquo;The holiday season always is such a busy
time. Folks have their shopping to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not Dad. Usually he just calls up the Personal
Shopper at Hobson&rsquo;s store and says: &lsquo;She&rsquo;s five-feet
three, size twelve and likes bright colors. Send out
something done up in gift wrapping and charge to
my account.&rsquo;&rdquo; Penny sighed drearily. &ldquo;Then after
Christmas I have to take it back and ask for an exchange.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you ever tried giving your father a list?&rdquo;
suggested Mrs. Downey, smiling at the description.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Often. He nearly always ignores it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you ask him for this year?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only a new automobile.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only! My goodness, aren&rsquo;t your tastes rather expensive?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">[133]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, he won&rsquo;t give it to me,&rdquo; replied Penny. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
probably get a sweater with pink and blue stripes or
some dead merchandise the store couldn&rsquo;t pawn off
on anyone except an unsuspecting father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Downey laughed as she picked up the tray.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope your father will be able to get to Pine Top
for Christmas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So do I,&rdquo; agreed Penny, frowning. &ldquo;I thought
when I wired him that Harvey Maxwell was here he
would come right away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He may have decided it would do no good to contact
the man. Knowing Mr. Maxwell I doubt if your
father could make any sort of deal with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If only he would come here he might be able to
learn something which would help his case,&rdquo; Penny
declared earnestly. &ldquo;Maxwell and Fergus are mixed
up in some queer business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Downey smiled tolerantly. While she always
listened attentively to Penny&rsquo;s theories and observations,
she had not been greatly excited by her tale of
the mysterious Green Room. She knew the two men
were unscrupulous in a business way and that they
were making every effort to force her to give up the
lodge, but she could not bring herself to believe they
were involved in more serious affairs. She thought that
Penny&rsquo;s great eagerness to prove Harvey Maxwell&rsquo;s
dishonesty had caused her imagination to run riot.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">[134]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Francine Sellberg wouldn&rsquo;t be at Pine Top if
something weren&rsquo;t in the wind,&rdquo; Penny went on reflectively.
&ldquo;She followed Ralph Fergus and Maxwell
here. And that in itself was rather strange.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you mean, Penny?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fergus must have been having trouble in managing
the hotel or he wouldn&rsquo;t have gone to Riverview
to see Maxwell. What he had to say evidently couldn&rsquo;t
be trusted to a letter or a telegram.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Fergus often absents himself on trips. Now
and then he goes to Canada.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder why?&rdquo; asked Penny alertly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He and Mr. Maxwell have a hotel there, I&rsquo;ve
heard. I doubt if his trips have any particular significance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, at any rate, Fergus brought Maxwell back
from Riverview to help him solve some weighty
problem. From their talk on the plane, I gathered
they were plotting to put you out of business, Mrs.
Downey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you are right there, Penny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why should your lodge annoy them? You
could never take a large number of guests away from
their hotel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ralph Fergus is trying to buy up the entire mountainside,&rdquo;
Mrs. Downey declared bitterly. &ldquo;He purchased
the site of the old mine, and I can&rsquo;t see what
good it will ever do the hotel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t suppose there&rsquo;s valuable mineral&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">[135]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Mrs. Downey broke in with an amused
laugh. &ldquo;The mine played out years ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has Mr. Fergus tried to buy your lodge?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s made me two different offers. Both were
hardly worth considering. If he comes through with
any reasonable proposition I may sell. My future
plans depend a great deal upon whether or not Peter
Jasko is willing to renew a lease on the ski slopes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When does the lease expire, Mrs. Downey?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The end of next month. I&rsquo;ve asked Mr. Jasko to
come and see me as soon as he can. However, I have
almost no hope he&rsquo;ll sign a new lease.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Downey carried the tray to the door. There
she paused to inquire: &ldquo;Anything I can bring you,
Penny? A book or a magazine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, thank you. But you might give me my portable
typewriter. I think I&rsquo;ll write a letter to Dad just
to remind him he still has a daughter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pulling a table to the bedside, Mrs. Downey placed
the typewriter and paper on it before going away.
Penny propped herself up with pillows and rolled a
blank sheet into the machine.</p>
<p>At the top of the page she pecked out: &ldquo;Bulletin.&rdquo;
After the dateline, she began in her best journalistic
style, using upper case letters:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">[136]</div>
<p>&ldquo;PENNY PARKER, ATTRACTIVE AND
TALENTED DAUGHTER OF ANTHONY
PARKER, WHILE RIDING THE TAIL OF A
RACING BOB-SLED WAS THROWN FOR A
TEN YARD LOSS, SUSTAINING NUMEROUS
BRUISES. THE PATIENT IS BEARING HER
SUFFERING WITH FORTITUDE AND ANTICIPATES
BEING IN CIRCULATION BY
GLMLFFLS&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny stared at the last word she had written. Inadvertently,
her fingers had struck the wrong letters.
She had intended to write &ldquo;tomorrow.&rdquo; With an exclamation
of impatience she jerked the paper from the
machine.</p>
<p>And then she studied the sentence she had typed
with new interest. There was something strangely familiar
about the jumbled word, GLMLFFLS.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks a little like that coded message I found!&rdquo;
she thought excitedly.</p>
<p>Forgetting her bruises, Penny rolled out of bed.
She struck the floor with a moan of anguish. Hobbling
over to the dresser, she found the scrap of paper
which she had saved, and brought it back to the bed.</p>
<p>The third word in the message was similar, although
not the same as the one she had written by accident.
Penny typed them one above the other.</p>
<div class="poem">
<p class="t0">GLMLFFLS</p>
<p class="t0">GLULFFLS</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">[137]</div>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re identical except for the third letter,&rdquo; she
mused. &ldquo;Why, I believe I have it! You simply strike
the letter directly below the true one&mdash;that is, the
one in the next row of keys. And when your true
letter is in the bottom row, you strike the corresponding
key on the top row. That&rsquo;s why I wrote an M
for a U!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny was certain she had deciphered the third
word of the code and that it was the same as she had
written unintentionally. Quickly she wrote out the
entire jumbled message, and under it her translation.</p>
<div class="poem">
<p class="t0">YL GFZKY GLULFFLS</p>
<p class="t0">NO TRAIN TOMORROW</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it!&rdquo; she chortled, bounding up and down
in bed.</p>
<p>And then her elation fled away. A puzzled expression
settled over her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have it, only I haven&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she muttered. &ldquo;What
can the message mean? There are no trains at Pine
Top&mdash;not even a railroad station. This leaves everything
in a worse puzzle than before!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">[138]</div>
<h2 id="c17"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">17</span>
<br /><i>STRANGE SOUNDS</i></h2>
<p>Penny felt reasonably certain that she had deciphered
the code correctly, but although she studied
over the message for nearly an hour, she could make
nothing of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No train tomorrow,&rdquo; she repeated to herself.
&ldquo;How silly! Perhaps it means, no <i>plane</i> tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She worked out the code a second time, checking
her letters carefully. There was no mistake.</p>
<p>Later in the evening when Mrs. Downey stopped
to inquire how she was feeling, Penny asked her
about the train service near Pine Top.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The nearest railroad is thirty miles away,&rdquo; replied
the woman. &ldquo;It is a very tedious journey to Pine Top
unless one comes by airplane.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is the plane service under the control of the
Fergus-Maxwell interests?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not to my knowledge,&rdquo; returned Mrs. Downey,
surprised by the question. &ldquo;This same airline company
sent planes here even before the Fergus hotel was
built, but not on a regular schedule.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">[139]</div>
<p>Left alone once more, Penny slipped the typewritten
message under her pillow and drew a long sigh.
Somehow she was making no progress in any line.
From whom had Ralph Fergus received the coded
note, and what was its meaning?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never learn anything lying here in bed,&rdquo; she
murmured gloomily. &ldquo;Tomorrow I&rsquo;ll get up even if
it kills me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>True to her resolve, she was downstairs in time
for breakfast the next morning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Penny,&rdquo; protested Mrs. Downey anxiously,
&ldquo;don&rsquo;t you think you should have stayed in bed? I
can tell it hurts you to walk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll limber up with exercise. I may take a little hike
down to the village later on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Downey sadly shook her head. She thought
that Penny had entirely too much determination for
her own good.</p>
<p>Until ten o&rsquo;clock Penny remained at the lodge,
rather hoping that Sara Jasko would put in an appearance.
When it was evident that the girl was not coming,
she bundled herself into warm clothing and
walked painfully down the mountain road. Observing
old Peter Jasko in the yard near the cabin, she did
not pause but went on until she drew near the Fergus
hotel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I dared go in there,&rdquo; she thought, stopping
to rest for a moment. &ldquo;But I most certainly would be
chased out.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">[140]</div>
<p>Penny sat down on a log bench in plain view of
the hostelry. Forming a snowball, she tossed it at a
squirrel. The animal scurried quickly to a low-hanging
tree branch and chattered his violent disapproval.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brother, that&rsquo;s the way I feel, too,&rdquo; declared Penny
soberly. &ldquo;You express my sentiments perfectly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was still sunk in deep gloom when she heard
a light step behind her. Turning her head stiffly she
saw Maxine Miller tramping through the snow toward
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it isn&rsquo;t Miss Parker!&rdquo; the actress exclaimed with
affected enthusiasm. &ldquo;How delighted I am to see you
again, my dear. I heard about the marvelous way you
stopped the bob-sled yesterday. Such courage! You
deserve a medal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would rather have some new skin,&rdquo; said Penny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I imagine you do feel rather bruised and battered,&rdquo;
the actress replied with a show of sympathy. &ldquo;But
how proud you must be of yourself! Everyone is talking
about it! As I was telling Mr. Jasko last night&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were talking with Peter Jasko?&rdquo; broke in
Penny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he came to the hotel to see Mr. Fergus&mdash;something
about a lease, I think. Imagine! He hadn&rsquo;t heard
a word about the accident, and his granddaughter was
in it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You told him all about it I suppose?&rdquo; Penny asked
with a moan.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">[141]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he was tremendously impressed. Why, what
is the matter? Do you have a pain somewhere?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Several of them,&rdquo; said Penny. &ldquo;Go on. What did
Mr. Jasko say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much of anything. He just listened. Shouldn&rsquo;t
I have told him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sorry you did, but it can&rsquo;t be helped now.
Mr. Jasko doesn&rsquo;t like to have his granddaughter ski
or take any part in winter sports.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I didn&rsquo;t know that. Then I did let the cat out
of the bag. I thought he acted rather peculiar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was bound to have found out about it sooner
or later,&rdquo; Penny sighed. With a quick change of mood
she inquired: &ldquo;What&rsquo;s doing down at the hotel? Any
excitement?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything is about as usual. I&rsquo;ve sold two fur
coats. Don&rsquo;t you think you might be interested in one
yourself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would be interested but my pocketbook
wouldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;These coats are a marvelous bargain,&rdquo; Miss Miller
declared. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you at least look at them and
try one on. Come down to the hotel with me now
and I&rsquo;ll arrange for you to meet my employer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;&rdquo; Penny hesitated, &ldquo;could we enter the
hotel by the back way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose so,&rdquo; replied the actress in surprise.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re sensitive about being crippled?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">[142]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. I don&rsquo;t care to meet anyone I know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can slip into the hotel the back way, then.
Very few persons use the rear corridors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny and Miss Miller approached the building
without being observed. They entered at the back,
meeting neither Ralph Fergus or Harvey Maxwell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you climb a flight of stairs?&rdquo; the actress asked
doubtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, easily. I much prefer it to the elevator.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You really walk with only a slight limp,&rdquo; declared
Miss Miller. &ldquo;I see no reason why you should feel so
sensitive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just my nature,&rdquo; laughed Penny. &ldquo;Lend me
your arm, and up we go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They ascended to the second floor. Miss Miller motioned
for the girl to sit down on a sofa not far from
the elevator.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You wait here and I&rsquo;ll bring my employer,&rdquo; she offered.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be back in a few minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is this man?&rdquo; inquired Penny.</p>
<p>The actress did not hear the question. She had
turned away and was descending the stairs again to
the lobby floor.</p>
<p>For a moment or two the girl sat with her head
against the back rest of the sofa, completely relaxed.
The trip down the mountainside had tired her more
than she had expected. She was afraid she had made a
mistake in coming boldly to the hotel. If Harvey Maxwell
caught her there he would not treat her kindly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">[143]</div>
<p>As for seeing the fur coats, she had no intention of
ever making a purchase. She had agreed to look at
them because she was curious to learn the identity of
Miss Miller&rsquo;s employer, as well as the nature of the
proposition which might be made her.</p>
<p>Presently, Penny&rsquo;s attention was directed to a distant
sound, low and rhythmical, carrying a staccato
overtone.</p>
<p>At first the girl paid little heed to the sound. No
doubt it was just another noise incidental to a large
hotel&mdash;some machine connected with the cleaning
services perhaps.</p>
<p>But gradually, the sound impressed itself deeper on
her mind. There was something strangely familiar
about it, yet she could not make a positive identification.</p>
<p>Penny arose from the sofa and listened intently.
The sound seemed to be coming from far down the
left hand hall. She proceeded slowly, pausing frequently
in an effort to discover whence it came. She
entered a side hall and the noise increased noticeably.</p>
<p>Suddenly Penny heard footsteps behind her. Turning
slightly she was dismayed to see Ralph Fergus
coming toward her. For an instant she was certain
he meant to eject her from the hotel. Then, she realized
that his head was down, and that he was paying
no particular attention to her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">[144]</div>
<p>Penny kept her back turned and walked even more
slowly. The man overtook her, passed without so
much as bestowing a glance upon her. He went to a
door which bore the number 27 and, taking a key
from his pocket, fitted it into the lock.</p>
<p>Penny would have thought nothing of his act, save
that as he swung back the door, the strange sound
which previously had drawn her attention, increased
in volume. It died away again as the door closed behind
Fergus.</p>
<p>Waiting a moment, Penny went on down the hall
and paused near the room where the hotel man had
entered. She looked quickly up and down the hall.
No one was in sight.</p>
<p>Moving closer, she pressed her ear to the panel.
There was no sound inside the room, but as she
waited, the rhythmical chugging began again. And
suddenly she knew what caused it&mdash;a teletype machine!</p>
<p>Often in her father&rsquo;s newspaper office Penny had
heard that same sound and had watched the printers
recording news from all parts of the country. There
was no mistaking it, for she could plainly distinguish
the clicking of the type against the platen, the low
hum of the machine itself, the quick clang of the little
bell at the end of each line of copy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What would the hotel be doing with a teletype?&rdquo;
she mused. &ldquo;They print no newspapers here.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">[145]</div>
<p>Into Penny&rsquo;s mind leaped a startling thought. The
coded message in upper case letters which Fergus had
dropped in the snow! Might it not have been printed
by a teletype machine?</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what significance <i>could</i> it have?&rdquo; she asked
herself. &ldquo;From what office are the messages being sent
and for what purpose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It seemed to Penny that the answer to her many
questions might lie, not in the Green Room as she
had supposed, but close at hand in Number 27.</p>
<p>Her ear pressed to the panel, the girl made out a
low rumble of voices above the clatter of the teletype.
Ralph Fergus was talking with another man but she
could not distinguish a word they were saying. So
intent was she that she failed to hear a step behind her.</p>
<p>A mop handle clattered to the floor, making a loud
sound on the tiles. Penny whirled about in confusion.
A cleaning maid stood beside her, regarding her with
evident though unspoken suspicion.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">[146]</div>
<h2 id="c18"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">18</span>
<br /><i>QUESTIONS AND CLUES</i></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Good morning,&rdquo; stammered Penny, backing
from the door. &ldquo;Were you wanting to get into this
room?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I never clean in there,&rdquo; answered the maid,
still watching the girl with suspicion. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re looking
for someone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny knew that she had been observed listening
at the door. It would be foolish to pretend otherwise.</p>
<p>She answered frankly: &ldquo;No, I was passing through
the corridor when I heard a strange sound in this
room. Do you hear it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The maid nodded and her distrustful attitude
changed to one of indifference.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a machine of some sort,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;I hear
it running every once in a while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny was afraid to loiter by the door any longer
lest her own voice bring Ralph Fergus to investigate.
As the cleaning woman picked up her mop and started
on down the hall, she fell into step with her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who occupies Room 27?&rdquo; she inquired casually.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">[147]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No one,&rdquo; said the maid. &ldquo;The hotel uses it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What goes on in there anyway? I thought I heard
teletype machines.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The maid was unfamiliar with the technical name
Penny had used. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just a contraption that prints
letters and figures,&rdquo; she informed. &ldquo;When I first came
to work at the hotel I made a mistake and went in
there to do some cleaning. Mr. Fergus, he didn&rsquo;t like
it and said I wasn&rsquo;t to bother to dust up there again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t anyone go into the room except Mr. Fergus?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just him and George Jewitt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And who is he? One of the owners of the hotel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no. George Jewitt works for Mr. Fergus. He
takes care of the machines, I guess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were saying that the machine prints letters
and figures,&rdquo; prompted Penny. &ldquo;Do you mean messages
one can read?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was writing crazy-like when I watched it. The
letters didn&rsquo;t make sense nohow. Mr. Fergus he told
me the machines were being used in some experiment
the hotel was carrying on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who occupies the nearby rooms?&rdquo; Penny questioned.
&ldquo;I should think they would be disturbed by
the machines.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rooms on this corridor are never assigned unless
everything else is full up,&rdquo; the maid explained.</p>
<p>Pausing at a door, the cleaning woman fitted a
master key into the lock.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">[148]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s one thing more I&rsquo;m rather curious about,&rdquo;
said Penny quickly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s this Green Room I hear
folks mentioning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The maid gazed at her suspiciously again. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
know anything about any Green Room,&rdquo; she replied.</p>
<p>Entering the bedroom with her cleaning paraphernalia,
she closed the door behind her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Went a bit too far that time,&rdquo; thought Penny,
&ldquo;but at least I learned a few facts of interest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Turning, she retraced her steps to Room 27, but
she was afraid to linger there lest Ralph Fergus should
discover her loitering in the hall. Miss Miller had not
put in an appearance when she returned to the elevators.
She decided not to wait.</p>
<p>Scribbling a brief note of explanation, Penny left
the paper in a corner of the sofa and hobbled down
the stairway to the first floor. She let herself out the
back way without attracting undue attention. Safely
in the open once more she retreated to her bench
under the ice-coated trees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I need to give this whole problem a good think,&rdquo;
she told herself. &ldquo;Here I have a number of perfectly
good clues but they don&rsquo;t fit together. I&rsquo;m almost as
far from getting evidence against Fergus and Maxwell
as I was at the start.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">[149]</div>
<p>Penny could not understand why the hotel would
have need for teletype machine service. Such machines
were used in newspaper offices, for railroad communication,
brokerage service, and occasionally in very
large plants with widely separated branch offices. Suddenly
she recalled that her father had once told her
Mr. Maxwell kept in touch with his chain of hotels
by means of such a wire service. Surely it was an expensive
and unnecessary means of communication.</p>
<p>The cleaning woman&rsquo;s information that messages
came through in unintelligible form convinced Penny
a code was being used&mdash;a code to which she had the
key. But why did Maxwell and Fergus find it necessary
to employ one? If their messages concerned only
the routine operation of the various hotels in the
chain, there would be no need for secrecy.</p>
<p>The one message she had interpreted&mdash;&ldquo;No Train
Tomorrow&rdquo;&mdash;undoubtedly had been received by
teletype transmission. But Penny could not hazard a
guess as to its true meaning. She feared it might be in
double code, and that the words did not have the significance
usually attributed to them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If only I could get into Room 27 and get my
hands on additional code messages I might be able
to make something out of it,&rdquo; she mused. &ldquo;The problem
is how to do it without being caught.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny had not lost interest in the Green Room.
She was inclined to believe that its mystery was
closely associated with the communication system of
the hotel. But since, for the time being at least, the
problem of penetrating beyond the guarded Green
Door seemed unsolvable, she thought it wiser to center
her sleuthing attack elsewhere.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">[150]</div>
<p>&ldquo;All I can do for the next day or so is to keep an
eye on Ralph Fergus and Harvey Maxwell,&rdquo; she told
herself. &ldquo;If I see a chance to get inside Room 27 I&rsquo;ll
take it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny arose with a sigh. She would not be likely
to have such a chance unless she made it for herself.
And in her present battered state, her mind somehow
refused to invent clever schemes.</p>
<p>The walk back up the mountain road was a long
and tiring one. Finally reaching the lodge after many
pauses for rest, Penny stood for a time watching the
skiers, and then entered the house.</p>
<p>Mrs. Downey was not in the kitchen. Hearing
voices from the living room, Penny went to the doorway
and paused there. The hotel woman was talking
with a visitor, old Peter Jasko.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; Penny apologized for her intrusion.
She started to retreat.</p>
<p>Peter Jasko saw her and the muscles of his leathery
face tightened. Pushing back his chair he got quickly
to his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the one who has been trespassing on my
land!&rdquo; he accused, his voice unsteady from anger.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been helping my granddaughter disobey my
orders!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Taken by surprise, Penny could think of nothing
to say in her own defense.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">[151]</div>
<p>After his first outburst, Peter Jasko ignored the
girl. Turning once more to Mrs. Downey he said in
a rasping voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have my final decision, Ma&rsquo;am. I shall not renew
the lease.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please, Mr. Jasko,&rdquo; Mrs. Downey argued quietly.
&ldquo;Think what this means to me! If I lose the ski slopes
I shall be compelled to give up the lodge. I&rsquo;ve already
offered you more than I can afford to pay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Money ain&rsquo;t no object,&rdquo; the old man retorted.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m against the whole proposition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing I can say will make you reconsider?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing, Ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Picking up his cap, a ridiculous looking affair with
ear muffs, Peter Jasko brushed past Penny and went
out the door.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">[152]</div>
<h2 id="c19"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">19</span>
<br /><i>PETER JASKO SERVES NOTICE</i></h2>
<p>After the old man had gone, Penny spoke apologetically
to Mrs. Downey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m so sorry! I ruined everything, coming in
just when I did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Downey sat with her hands folded in her lap,
staring out the window after the retreating figure of
Peter Jasko.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it wasn&rsquo;t your fault, Penny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was angry at me because I&rsquo;ve been helping
Sara get in and out of the cabin. I never should have
done it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps not,&rdquo; agreed Mrs. Downey, &ldquo;but it would
have made no difference in regard to the lease. I&rsquo;ve
been expecting Jasko&rsquo;s decision. Even so, it comes as
a blow. This last week I had been turning ideas over
in my mind, trying to think of a way I could keep on
here. Now everything is settled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny crossed the room and slipped an arm about
the woman&rsquo;s shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m as sorry as I can be.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">[153]</div>
<p>With a sudden change of mood, Mrs. Downey
arose and gave Penny&rsquo;s hand an affectionate squeeze.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Losing the lodge won&rsquo;t mean the end of the
world,&rdquo; she said lightly. &ldquo;While I may not be able to
sell the place for a very good price now that the ski
slopes are gone, I&rsquo;ll at least get something from Mr.
Maxwell. And I have a small income derived from my
husband&rsquo;s insurance policy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where will you go if you leave here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t given that part any thought,&rdquo; admitted
Mrs. Downey. &ldquo;I may do a little traveling. I have a
sister in Texas I might visit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be lonesome for Pine Top.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; admitted Mrs. Downey, &ldquo;this place will always
seem like home to me. And I&rsquo;ve lived a busy,
useful life for so many years it will be hard to let go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Possibly Peter Jasko will reconsider his decision.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Downey smiled and shook her head. &ldquo;Not
Peter. I&rsquo;ve known him for many years, although I
can&rsquo;t say I ever became acquainted with him. Once
he makes a stand nothing can sway him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is he entirely right in his mind?&rdquo; Penny asked
dubiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes. He&rsquo;s peculiar, that&rsquo;s all. And he&rsquo;s getting
old.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Despite Mrs. Downey&rsquo;s avowal that no one was responsible
for Peter Jasko&rsquo;s decision, Penny considered
herself at fault. She could not blame the old man for
being provoked because she had helped his granddaughter
escape from the cabin.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">[154]</div>
<p>&ldquo;If I went down there and apologized it might do
some good,&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;At least, nothing will be
lost by trying.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny turned the plan over in her mind, saying
nothing about it to Mrs. Downey. It seemed to her
that the best way would be to wait for a few hours
until Peter Jasko had been given an opportunity to
get over his anger.</p>
<p>The afternoon dragged on slowly. Toward nightfall,
finding confinement intolerable, Penny ventured
out-of-doors to try her skis. She was thrilled to discover
that she could use them without too much discomfort.</p>
<p>Going to the kitchen window, she called to Mrs.
Downey that she intended to do a little skiing and
might be late for dinner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Penny, you&rsquo;re not able,&rdquo; the woman protested,
raising the sash. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only your determination
which drives you on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m feeling much better,&rdquo; insisted Penny. &ldquo;I want
to go down the mountain and see Sara.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be a hard climb back,&rdquo; warned Mrs. Downey.
&ldquo;And the radio reported another bad storm coming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I want to go now,&rdquo; answered Penny.
&ldquo;We may be snowbound by tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if you must go, don&rsquo;t overtax your strength,&rdquo;
cautioned Mrs. Downey.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">[155]</div>
<p>Penny wrapped a woolen scarf tightly about her
neck as a protection against the biting wind. Cautiously,
she skied down the trail, finding its frozen
surface treacherous, and scarcely familiar. In the
rapidly gathering dusk nothing looked exactly the
same as by daylight. Trees towered like unfriendly
giants, obscuring the path.</p>
<p>Before Penny had covered half the distance to
Jasko&rsquo;s cabin, snowflakes, soft and damp, began to
fall. They came faster and faster, the wind whirling
them directly into her face. She kept her head down
and wished that she had remained by the crackling
log fire at the Downey lodge.</p>
<p>Swinging out of the forest, Penny was hard pressed
to remember the trail. As she hesitated, trying to decide
which way to go, she felt her skis slipping along
a downgrade where none should have been. Too late,
she realized that she was heading down into a deep
ravine which terminated in an ice-sheeted river below.</p>
<p>Throwing herself flat, Penny sought to save herself,
but she kept sliding, sliding. A stubby evergreen
at last stayed her fall. She clung helplessly to it for
a moment, recovering her breath. Then she tried to
pull herself up the steep incline. She slipped and
barely caught hold of the bush to save herself from
another bad fall. Sharp pains shot through her side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I&rsquo;ve fixed myself for sure,&rdquo; she thought.
&ldquo;How will I ever get out of this hole?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">[156]</div>
<p>The ravine offered protection from the chill wind,
but the snow was sifting down steadily. Penny could
feel her clothing becoming thoroughly soaked. If she
should lie still she soon would freeze.</p>
<p>Again Penny tried to struggle up the bank, and
again she slid backwards. From sheer desperation
rather than because she cherished a hope that anyone
would hear, Penny shouted for help.</p>
<p>An answering halloo echoed to her through the
trees.</p>
<p>Penny dared not hope that the voice was other than
her own. &ldquo;Help! Help!&rdquo; she called once more.</p>
<p>Her heart leaped. The cry which came back definitely
belonged to a man! And as she marveled at the
miracle of a rescue, a dark figure loomed up at the
rim of the ravine.</p>
<p>A gruff voice called to her: &ldquo;Hold on! Don&rsquo;t try to
move! I&rsquo;ll get a rope and be back!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man faded back into the darkness. Penny clung
to the bush until it seemed her arms would break.
Snow fell steadily, caking her hood and penetrating
the woolen suit.</p>
<p>Then as the girl lost all awareness of time, she
caught the flash of a lighted lantern. Her rescuer appeared
again at the top of the ravine and lowered a
rope. She grasped it, wrapping it tightly about her
wrist, and climbed as best she could while the man
pulled from above.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">[157]</div>
<p>At last Penny reached the top, falling in an exhausted
heap on the snow. Raising her head she stared
into the face of her rescuer. The man was Peter
Jasko.</p>
<p>He recognized her at the same instant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You!&rdquo; he exclaimed.</p>
<p>For one disturbing moment Penny thought the old
man meant to push her back down into the yawning
ravine. In the yellow glow of the lantern, the expression
of his face was terrifying.</p>
<p>Gaining control of himself, Peter Jasko demanded
gruffly: &ldquo;Hurt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve twisted my ankle.&rdquo; Penny pulled herself up
from the ground, took a step, and recoiled with pain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me have a look at it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jasko bent down and examined the ankle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No bones broken,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re luckier than
you deserve. Any fool who doesn&rsquo;t know enough to
keep off skis ought to be crippled for life!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such a cheerful philosophy,&rdquo; observed Penny
ironically. &ldquo;Well, thanks anyhow for saving me. Even
if you are sorry you did it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man made no immediate reply. He stood
gazing down at Penny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Reckon I owe you something,&rdquo; he said grudgingly.
&ldquo;Sara told me how you kept the bob-sled from going
off the track. Injured yourself, too, didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">[158]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You had no business helping Sara go against my
will,&rdquo; the old man said, his anger rising again. &ldquo;I told
you to stay away, didn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You did. I was sorry to disobey your orders, Mr.
Jasko, but I think you are unjust to your granddaughter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;re not being fair to Mrs. Downey either,&rdquo;
Penny went on courageously. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s struggled for
years to make her lodge profitable, fought against
overwhelming odds while the Fergus interests have
done everything they can to put her out of business.
Unless you renew her lease, she&rsquo;ll be forced to leave
Pine Top.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So?&rdquo; inquired the old man, unmoved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s fighting with her back to the wall. And now
you&rsquo;ve dealt her the final blow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one asked Mrs. Downey to come here in the
first place,&rdquo; replied Peter Jasko. &ldquo;Or them other hotel
people either. Pine Top can get along without the
lot of &rsquo;em. The sooner they all clear out the better
I&rsquo;ll like it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure of that,&rdquo; said Penny. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t care how
much trouble you cause other folks. Because of your
own son&rsquo;s death you have taken an unnatural attitude
toward skiing. You hate everything remotely connected
with the sport. But it isn&rsquo;t fair. Your granddaughter
has a right to a certain amount of freedom.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">[159]</div>
<p>Peter Jasko listened to the girl&rsquo;s words in silence.
When she had finished he said in a strangely shaken
voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;My son met his death going on ten years ago. It
was on this trail&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; Penny said contritely. &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t
have spoken the way I did. Actually, I was on my way
down the mountain to tell you I deeply regret helping
Sara to go against your will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My granddaughter is headstrong,&rdquo; the old man
replied slowly. &ldquo;I want what&rsquo;s best for her. That&rsquo;s
why I&rsquo;ve tried to protect her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve done what you thought was
right,&rdquo; Penny returned. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you see Mrs.
Downey again and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; said the old man stubbornly. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t say
anything which will make me change my mind. Take
my arm and see if you can walk!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny struggled forward, supported by Jasko&rsquo;s
strong arm. Although each step sent a wracking pain
through her leg she made no sound of protest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t make it that way,&rdquo; the old man declared,
pausing. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to fix up a sled and pull you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Going back for Penny&rsquo;s skis which had been left
at the top of the ravine, he lashed them together. She
lay full length on the runners, and he towed her until
they came within view of the cabin. A light glowed in
the window.</p>
<p>On level ground, Penny tried walking again, and
managed to reach the cabin door.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">[160]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You go on inside,&rdquo; the old man directed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
hitch up the bob-sled and take you home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny pushed open the door only to hesitate on the
threshold. The room was filled with tobacco smoke.
Two men sat at the table, and directly behind them
stood Sara Jasko.</p>
<p>The girl came swiftly to the door. She gave Penny
a warm smile of welcome, not noticing that she had
been hurt, and said anxiously to Mr. Jasko:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grandfather, you have visitors. Mr. Fergus and
Mr. Maxwell are waiting to see you. I think it&rsquo;s about
the lease.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve nothing to say to them,&rdquo; returned the old
man grimly.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, he followed the two girls into the
room, closing the door against the wind and snow.</p>
<p>The situation was an awkward one for Penny.
Ralph Fergus and Harvey Maxwell both stared at her
with undisguised dislike and suspicion. Then, the
former arose, and ignoring her entirely, stepped forward
to meet the old man, his hand extended.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good evening, sir,&rdquo; he said affably. &ldquo;Mr. Maxwell
and I have a little business to discuss with you, if you
can spare us a moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peter Jasko ignored the offered hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t changed my mind since the last time we
talked,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not signing any lease!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">[161]</div>
<p>Penny scarcely heard the words for she was staring
beyond Ralph Fergus at his overcoat which hung
over the vacated chair. The garment was light brown
and the top button, a large one of the same color, had
been torn from the cloth.</p>
<p>Shifting her gaze, Penny glanced at Sara. The girl
nodded her head slowly up and down. She, too, had
made the important observation, and was thinking the
same thought. There could be little doubt of it&mdash;Ralph
Fergus was the man who had weakened the
brake rod of their bob-sled!</p>

<br /><i>VISITORS</i></h2>
<p>&ldquo;May we see you alone, Mr. Jasko?&rdquo; requested
Ralph Fergus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t reckon there&rsquo;s any need for being so all-fired
private,&rdquo; the old man retorted, his hand on the
doorknob. &ldquo;If you want to talk with me speak your
piece right out. I got to hitch up the team.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Fergus and his companion, Harvey Maxwell,
glanced coldly toward Penny who had sunk down
into a chair and was massaging her ankle. They were
reluctant to reveal their business before her but there
was no other way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t talk with you very well while you&rsquo;re
poised for flight, Mr. Jasko,&rdquo; Ralph Fergus said placatingly.
&ldquo;My friend, Maxwell, has prepared a paper
which he would like to have you look over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not signin&rsquo; anything!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good for you, Grandfather!&rdquo; muttered Sara under
her breath.</p>
<p>The two men pretended not to hear. Mr. Maxwell
took a folded document from his pocket and spread
it out on the kitchen table.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">[163]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Will you just read this, please, Mr. Jasko? You&rsquo;ll
find our terms are more than generous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t interested in your terms,&rdquo; he snapped. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
aimin&rsquo; to keep every acre of my land.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not asking you to sell, only to lease,&rdquo; Mr.
Fergus interposed smoothly. &ldquo;Now we understand
that your deal with Mrs. Downey has fallen through,
so there&rsquo;s no reason why you shouldn&rsquo;t lease the ski
slopes to us. We are prepared to offer you twice the
amount she proposed to give you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Jasko stubbornly shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re taking a very short-sighted attitude,&rdquo; said
Ralph Fergus, beginning to lose patience. &ldquo;At least
read the paper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think what this would mean to your granddaughter,&rdquo;
interposed Harvey Maxwell. &ldquo;Pretty
clothes, school in the city perhaps&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t listen to them, Grandfather,&rdquo; spoke Sara
quickly. &ldquo;I have enough clothes. And Pine Top school
suits me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re wastin&rsquo; your time and mine,&rdquo; said Peter
Jasko. &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t leasing my land to anybody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re only asking you to sign a three-year
lease&mdash;&rdquo; Mr. Fergus argued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you understand plain language?&rdquo; the old
man cried. &ldquo;You think money will buy everything,
but you got another guess coming. I&rsquo;ve seen enough
skiing at Pine Top and I aim to put a stop to it!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">[164]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use,&rdquo; said Harvey Maxwell resignedly to
his companion.</p>
<p>Ralph Fergus picked up the paper and thrust it
into his overcoat pocket. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re an old fool, Jasko!&rdquo;
he muttered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you dare speak that way to my grandfather!&rdquo;
Sara cried, her eyes stormy. &ldquo;You had your
nerve coming here anyway, after that trick you
tried!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trick?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You deliberately weakened the brake rod of our
bob-sled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ralph Fergus laughed in the girl&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
as touched as your grandfather,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you can explain what became of the top
button of your overcoat,&rdquo; suggested Penny coming
to Sara&rsquo;s support. &ldquo;And don&rsquo;t try to tell us it&rsquo;s home
in your sewing basket!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ralph Fergus&rsquo; hand groped at the vacant spot on
his coat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does a button have to do with the bob-sled
accident?&rdquo; inquired Harvey Maxwell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It happens that we found a large brown button in
the tool house at the Downey lodge,&rdquo; replied Penny.
&ldquo;Also a little additional evidence which rather suggests
Mr. Fergus is the one who tampered with the
bob-sled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ridiculous!&rdquo; protested the hotel man. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve not
even been near Mrs. Downey&rsquo;s lodge in weeks.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">[165]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I know that&rsquo;s a lie,&rdquo; said Peter Jasko. &ldquo;I saw you
goin&rsquo; up that way Friday night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you went there to damage the bob-sled!&rdquo;
Sara accused. &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t care how many persons
might be injured in an accident!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ralph Fergus&rsquo; face was an angry red. &ldquo;What reason
would I have for doing anything like that?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guests were being drawn from your hotel because
bob-sledding was increasing in popularity,&rdquo; said
Penny quietly. &ldquo;Nothing would please you more than
to put Mrs. Downey out of business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you drawing rather sweeping conclusions?&rdquo;
inquired Harvey Maxwell in an insolent tone.
&ldquo;A button isn&rsquo;t very certain evidence. So many persons
wear buttons, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I lost this one from my coat weeks ago,&rdquo; added
Ralph Fergus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was your button we found,&rdquo; Sara accused.</p>
<p>Peter Jasko had been listening intently to the argument,
taking little part in it. But now, with a quick
movement which belied his age, he moved across the
kitchen toward the gun rack on the wall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s be getting out of here,&rdquo; muttered Harvey
Maxwell.</p>
<p>He and Ralph Fergus both bolted out of the door.
Their sudden flight delighted Sara who broke into a
fit of laughter.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">[166]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you shoot once or twice into the air
just to give &rsquo;em a good fright?&rdquo; she asked her grandfather.</p>
<p>The old man, shotgun in hand, had followed the
two men to the door. But he did not shoot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grandfather wouldn&rsquo;t hurt a flea really,&rdquo; chuckled
Sara. &ldquo;At least, not unless it was trying to make him
sign something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ralph Fergus acted guilty, all right,&rdquo; declared
Penny, bending down to massage her injured ankle.
&ldquo;But it may have been a mistake for us to accuse him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t help it,&rdquo; answered Sara. &ldquo;When I saw
that button missing from his coat, I had to say something
about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peter Jasko put away his shotgun, turning once
more to the door. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll hitch up the team,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;Sara, get some liniment and see what you can do for
Miss Parker&rsquo;s ankle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your ankle?&rdquo; gasped Sara, staring at Penny. &ldquo;Have
you hurt yourself again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I managed to fall into the ravine a few minutes ago.
Your grandfather saved me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sara darted to the stove to get a pan of warm water.
She stripped off Penny&rsquo;s woolen stockings and examined
the foot as she soaked it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose this will put me on the shelf for another
day or so,&rdquo; Penny observed gloomily. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m lucky
I didn&rsquo;t break my neck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ankle is swollen,&rdquo; Sara said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wrap it with
a bandage and that may make it feel better.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">[167]</div>
<p>With a practiced hand she wound strips of gauze
and adhesive tape about the ankle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, how does it feel now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Much better,&rdquo; said Penny. &ldquo;Thanks a lot. I&mdash;I feel
rather mean to put your grandfather to so much
trouble, especially after the way I&rsquo;ve crossed him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t you worry about Grandfather,&rdquo; laughed
Sara. &ldquo;He likes you, Penny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He <i>likes</i> me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could tell by the way he acted tonight. He respects
a person who stands up to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I said some rather unnecessary things,&rdquo; Penny
declared regretfully. &ldquo;I was provoked because he
wouldn&rsquo;t sign a lease with Mrs. Downey. After hearing
what he said to Fergus and Maxwell I realize
nothing will sway him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sara sighed as she helped her friend put on her shoe
again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid not. I&rsquo;ll do what I can to influence him,
but I can tell you now he&rsquo;ll never listen to me. Grandfather
is just the way he is, and one can&rsquo;t budge him
an inch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peter Jasko soon had the team hitched to the bob-sled.
He and Sara helped Penny in, wrapping blankets
around her so that she would be snug and warm during
the ride up the mountain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come down again whenever you can,&rdquo; invited
Sara. &ldquo;Only the next time don&rsquo;t try it after dark if
you&rsquo;re on skis.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">[168]</div>
<p>Penny glanced at the old man, but his face showed
no displeasure. Apparently, he no longer regarded
her as an interloper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come as soon as I can,&rdquo; she replied.</p>
<p>Peter Jasko clucked to the horses, and the sled
moved away from the cabin. Sara stood in the doorway
until it was out of sight.</p>
<p>During the slow ride up the mountain side, the old
man did not speak. But as they came at last to the
Downey lodge, and he lifted her from the sled, he
actually smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon it won&rsquo;t do any good to lock Sara up
after this,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re both too smart for an old
codger like me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Mr. Jasko,&rdquo; answered Penny, her eyes
shining. &ldquo;Thank you for everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The door of the lodge had opened, and Mrs.
Downey, a coat thrown over her shoulders, hurried
out into the snow. Not wishing to be drawn into a
conversation, Jasko leaped back into the sled, and with
a curt, &ldquo;Good evening,&rdquo; drove away.</p>
<p>With Mrs. Downey&rsquo;s help, Penny hobbled into the
house, and there related her latest misadventure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I declare, you&rsquo;ll be in the hospital yet,&rdquo; sighed the
woman. &ldquo;I feel tempted to adopt Mr. Jasko&rsquo;s tactics
and lock you up in your room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll stay there without being locked in,&rdquo; declared
Penny. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had enough skiing to last me until
Christmas at least.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">[169]</div>
<p>In the morning she felt so stiff and battered that she
could barely get out of bed. However, her ankle was
somewhat better and when occasion demanded, she
could hobble across the room without support.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ought to be all right in a day or so if only
you&rsquo;ll stay off your foot and give it a chance to get
well,&rdquo; declared Mrs. Downey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard to sit still,&rdquo; sighed Penny. &ldquo;There are so
many things I ought to be doing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From the kitchen window she could see the Fergus
hotel far down in the valley. She was impatient to pay
another visit there, although she realized that after the
previous evening&rsquo;s encounter with Ralph Fergus and
Harvey Maxwell, it would be more difficult than ever
to gain admittance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somehow I must manage to get into Room 27 and
learn what is going on there,&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;But how?
That is the question!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ever an active, energetic person, Penny became increasingly
restless as the day dragged on. During mid-afternoon,
observing that Jake had hitched up the
team to the sled, she inquired if he were driving down
to Pine Top.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I am sending him after supplies,&rdquo; explained
Mrs. Downey. &ldquo;And the newspapers&mdash;if there are
any.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I could go along for the ride.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Downey regarded Penny skeptically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I wouldn&rsquo;t get out of the sled,&rdquo; Penny said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">[170]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Is that a promise?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make it one. Nothing less than a fire or an
earthquake will get me out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jake brought the sled to the door, and helped the
girl into it. The day was cold. Snow fell steadily.
Mrs. Downey tucked warm bricks at Penny&rsquo;s feet and
wrapped her snugly in woolen blankets.</p>
<p>The ride down the mountainside was without event.
Penny began to regret that she had made the trip, for
the weather was more unpleasant than she had anticipated.
She burrowed deeper and deeper into the
blankets.</p>
<p>Jake pulled up at a hitching post in front of Pine
Top&rsquo;s grocery store.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t take me long,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Penny climbed down in the bottom of the sled, rearranging
her blankets so that only her eyes and forehead
were exposed to the cold. She had been sitting
there for some minutes when her attention was drawn
to a man who was approaching from far down the
street. Recognizing him as Ralph Fergus, she watched
with interest.</p>
<p>At the drugstore he paused. As if by prearrangement,
Benny Smith came out of the building. Penny
was too far away to hear their exchange of words,
but she saw the boy give all of his newspapers to
Ralph Fergus. In return, he received a bill which she
guessed might be of fairly high denomination.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">[171]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Probably five dollars,&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;The boy sells
all his papers to Fergus because he can make more that
way than by peddling them one by one. And he&rsquo;s
paid to keep quiet about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny was not especially surprised to discover that
the hotel man was buying up all the papers, for she
had suspected he was behind the trick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no law against it,&rdquo; she told herself. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
the trouble. Fergus and Maxwell are clever. So far
they&rsquo;ve done nothing which could possibly get them
into legal trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Presently Jake came out of the grocery store, carrying
a large box of supplies which he stowed in the sled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get the papers and then we&rsquo;ll be ready to start.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t bother,&rdquo; said Penny. &ldquo;There aren&rsquo;t any. I
just saw Ralph Fergus buy them all from the boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fergus, eh? And he&rsquo;s been puttin&rsquo; it out that the
papers never caught the plane!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was just another one of his little tricks to make
Mrs. Downey&rsquo;s guests dissatisfied.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now we know what he&rsquo;s about we&rsquo;ll put a stop
to it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; agreed Penny, &ldquo;but he&rsquo;ll only think of something
new to try.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As they started back toward the Downey lodge,
she was quiet, turning over various matters in her
mind. Since Mrs. Downey had decided to sell her
business, it scarcely seemed to matter what Ralph
Fergus did.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">[172]</div>
<p>The sled drew near the Jasko cabin and passed it,
turning a bend in the road. Suddenly Penny thought
she heard her name called. Glancing back she was
startled to see Sara Jasko running after the sled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait, Jake!&rdquo; Penny commanded. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Sara! Something
seems to be wrong!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">[173]</div>
<h2 id="c21"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">21</span>
<br /><i>OLD PETER&rsquo;S DISAPPEARANCE</i></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Whoa!&rdquo; shouted Jake, pulling on the reins.</p>
<p>The horses brought the heavy sled to a halt at the
side of the road. Sara, breathless from running so fast,
hurried up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m worried about Grandfather,&rdquo; she gasped out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He isn&rsquo;t sick?&rdquo; Penny asked quickly,</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but I haven&rsquo;t seen him since early this morning.
He went to chop wood at Hatter&rsquo;s place up the
mountain. He expected to be back in time for lunch
but he hasn&rsquo;t returned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll likely be along soon,&rdquo; said Jake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you don&rsquo;t know Grandfather,&rdquo; declared Sara,
her forehead wrinkling with anxiety. &ldquo;He always does
exactly as he says he will do. He never would have
stayed away this long unless something had happened.
He&rsquo;s getting on in years and I&rsquo;m afraid&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jake, couldn&rsquo;t we go up to Hatter&rsquo;s place, wherever
it is?&rdquo; Penny urged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure. It&rsquo;s not far from Mrs. Downey&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">[174]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Let me ride with you,&rdquo; Sara requested. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry
to cause you any trouble, but I have a feeling something
is wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jump in,&rdquo; invited Jake.</p>
<p>Sara climbed into the back of the sled, snuggling
down in the blankets beside Penny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grandfather may have hurt himself with the ax,&rdquo;
she said uneasily. &ldquo;Or he could have suffered a stroke.
The doctor says he has a touch of heart-trouble, but
he never will take care of himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll probably find him safe and sound,&rdquo; Penny
declared in a comforting way.</p>
<p>Jake stirred the horses to greater activity. In a short
while the sled passed the Downey grounds and went
on to the Hatter farm. Sara sprang out to unlock the
wooden gate which barred entrance to a narrow,
private road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see Grandfather&rsquo;s sled!&rdquo; she exclaimed.</p>
<p>Without waiting for Jake to drive through the
gate, she ran on down the road. Hearing her cry of
alarm, the man urged his horses on.</p>
<p>Reaching the clearing, Penny and Jake saw Sara
gazing about in bewilderment. Peter Jasko&rsquo;s team had
been tied to a tree and the sled box was half filled with
wood. An ax lay in the deep snow close by. But there
was no sign of the old man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is grandfather?&rdquo; Sara asked in a dazed voice.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">[175]</div>
<p>She called his name several times. Hearing no answer,
she ran deeper into the woods. Jake leaped
from the sled and joined in the search. Penny could
not bear to sit helplessly by. Deciding that the emergency
was equal to an earthquake or a fire, she eased
herself down from the sled.</p>
<p>Steadily falling snow had obliterated all tracks save
those made by the new arrivals. There was no clue to
indicate whether Peter Jasko had left the scene of his
own free will or had been the possible victim of
violence.</p>
<p>Jake and Sara searched at the edge of the woods
and returned to the clearing to report no success.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe your granddad went up to Hatter&rsquo;s place
to get warm,&rdquo; the man suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He never would have left his horses without
blanketing them,&rdquo; answered Sara. &ldquo;But let&rsquo;s go there
and inquire. Someone may have seen Grandfather.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They drove the bob-sled on through the woods to
an unpainted farm house. Claud Hatter himself opened
the door, and in response to Sara&rsquo;s anxious question,
he told her that he had seen Peter Jasko drive into the
place early that morning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t see him go away?&rdquo; Sara asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but come to think of it, I noticed a car turn
into the road. Must have been about ten o&rsquo;clock this
morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What sort of car?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man could give no additional information, for
he had not paid particular attention to the automobile.
However, he pulled on his heavy coat and boots, offering
to help organize a searching party.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">[176]</div>
<p>Sara and Penny remained at the farm house, but as
it became evident that the old man would not be found
quickly, Jake returned and took the girls down the
mountain to the Downey lodge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What could have happened to Grandfather?&rdquo; Sara
repeated over and over. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe he became
dazed and wandered away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish we knew who came in the car,&rdquo; said Penny.
&ldquo;That might explain a lot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&mdash;you think Grandfather met with violence?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope not,&rdquo; replied Penny earnestly. &ldquo;But it seems
very queer. Did your grandfather have enemies?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He antagonizes many folks without meaning to do
so. However, I can&rsquo;t think of anyone at Pine Top
who could be called an actual enemy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By nightfall the searching party had grown in size.
Nearly every male resident of Pine Top joined in the
hunt for Peter Jasko. Even the Fergus hotel sent two
employes to help comb the mountainside for the
missing old man.</p>
<p>Sara, nearly in a state of collapse, was put to bed
by Mrs. Downey, who kept telling the girl over and
over that she must not worry. In speaking with Penny,
the woman was far from optimistic. She expressed a
doubt that Peter Jasko ever would be found alive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He may have wandered off and fallen into a
crevasse.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">[177]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I am inclined to think he may have been spirited
away by whoever came up the private road in that
car,&rdquo; commented Penny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t imagine anyone bothering to kidnap Peter
Jasko,&rdquo; returned Mrs. Downey. &ldquo;He has no money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It does sound rather fantastic, I admit. Especially
in broad daylight. You didn&rsquo;t notice any automobile
on the main road this morning did you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only the Fergus hotel delivery truck. But I was
busy. A dozen might have passed without my noticing
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At nine o&rsquo;clock Jake came to the lodge with a discouraging
report. No trace of Peter Jasko had been
found. The search would continue throughout the
night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which way are you going?&rdquo; Penny inquired as
the man started to leave the house again. &ldquo;Up the
mountain or down?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Down,&rdquo; he returned. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m joining a party at Jasko&rsquo;s
own place. We aim to start combing the woods on
his farm next.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I ride with you?&rdquo; she requested. &ldquo;I want to
go down to the Fergus hotel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Penny, your ankle&mdash;&rdquo; protested Mrs. Downey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can get around on it,&rdquo; Penny said hurriedly.
&ldquo;See!&rdquo; She hobbled across the floor to prove her
words. &ldquo;And this is important. I want to see someone
at the hotel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So late at night?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">[178]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It really is important,&rdquo; Penny declared. &ldquo;Please
say I may go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; agreed Mrs. Downey reluctantly.</p>
<p>Jake took Penny all the way to the hotel. &ldquo;Shall I
help you inside?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; she declined hurriedly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make it fine
from here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After Jake had driven back up the road, Penny
limped around to the back entrance of the hotel. She
stood for several minutes staring up at the dark windows
of the second floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe Ralph Fergus and Harvey Maxwell know
plenty about Jasko&rsquo;s disappearance,&rdquo; she thought.
&ldquo;But how to prove it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the parking lot only a few steps away stood the
Fergus hotel delivery truck. Penny hobbled over to
it, and opened the rear door. She swept the beam of
her flashlight over the floor.</p>
<p>At first glance the car appeared to be empty save
for several cardboard boxes. Then she saw a heavy,
fleece-lined glove lying on the floor half hidden by the
containers. She picked it up, examined it briefly and
stuffed it into the pocket of her snowsuit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I remember Peter Jasko wore a glove very much
like this!&rdquo; she thought.</p>
<p>Softly closing the truck door, Penny went back to
the rear of the hotel. The lower hall was deserted so
she slipped inside, and followed the stairway to the
second floor. She tried the door of Room 27 and discovered
it was locked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">[179]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I was afraid of this,&rdquo; Penny muttered.</p>
<p>Hesitating a moment she went on down the hall.
Opening another door, the one which bore no number,
she saw that she was to be blocked again in her investigation.
The familiar guard sat at his usual post
beside the door of the Green Room.</p>
<p>Retreating without drawing attention to herself,
Penny debated her next action. Unless she found a
way to enter one of those two rooms of mystery, her
night would be wasted.</p>
<p>Moving softly down the hall, she paused to test the
door to the right of Room 27. To her astonishment,
it swung open when she turned the knob. The room
was dark and deserted.</p>
<p>Penny stepped inside, closing the door behind her.
Her flashlight beam disclosed only a dusty, bare bedroom,
its sole furnishing a thickly padded carpet.</p>
<p>Going to the window, Penny raised it and gazed
at the wide ledge which she had noted from below. If
she had perfect balance, if the window of Room 27
were unlocked, if her lame ankle did not let her
down, she <i>might</i> be able to span the distance! It would
be dangerous and she must run the risk of being observed
by persons on the grounds of the hotel. Penny
gazed down at the frozen yard far below and shuddered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">[180]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been pretty lucky in my falls so far,&rdquo; she
thought. &ldquo;But I have a feeling if I slip this time it will
be my last.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny pulled herself through the window. As the
full force of the wind struck her body, threatening
to hurl her from her precarious perch, she nearly lost
her courage. She clung to the sill for a moment, and
then without daring to look down, inched her way
along the ledge.</p>
<p>Reaching the other window in safety, she tried to
push it up. For a dreadful instant, Penny was certain
she could not. But it gave so suddenly she nearly lost
her balance. Holding desperately to the sill, she recovered,
and raised the window.</p>
<p>Penny dropped lightly through the opening into
the dark room. Pains were shooting through her ankle,
but so great was her excitement she scarcely was aware
of any discomfort.</p>
<p>She flashed her light about the room. As she had
suspected, there were two teletype machines, neither
of which was in operation. A chair had been pulled
up to a direct-keyboard machine similar to one Penny
had seen in her father&rsquo;s newspaper office. Save for
a wooden table the room contained nothing else.</p>
<p>Penny went over to the machines and focused her
light upon the paper in the rollers. It was blank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is maddening!&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;I take a big
risk to get in here and what do I find&mdash;nothing!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">[181]</div>
<p>Footsteps could be heard coming down the hallway.
Penny remained perfectly still, expecting the
person to pass on. Instead, the noise ceased altogether
and a key grated in the door lock.</p>
<p>In panic, Penny glanced frantically about. She
could not hope to get out the window in time to escape
detection. The only available hiding place was a
closet.</p>
<p>Switching off her light, Penny opened the door.
Stepping inside, she closed it softly behind her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">[182]</div>
<h2 id="c22"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">22</span>
<br /><i>THE SECRET STAIRS</i></h2>
<p>In the darkness, Penny felt something soft and
covered with fur brush against her face. She recoiled,
nearly screaming in terror. Recovering her poise and
realizing that she had merely touched a garment which
hung in the closet, she flattened herself against the
wall and waited.</p>
<p>The outside door opened and soft footsteps approached
the wall switches. Lights flashed on. A tall,
swarthy man in a gray business suit blinked at the
sudden flood of illumination. After a moment he
stepped over to the teletype machines, and throwing
a switch, started them going.</p>
<p>Sitting down to the keyboard he tapped out a
message. Then he lit a cigarette and waited. In a few
minutes his answer came, typed out from some distant
station. The man ripped the copy from the machine
and read it carefully. Its contents seemed to please
him for he smiled broadly as he arose from the chair,
leaving the teletypes still running.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">[183]</div>
<p>Penny froze with fear when she heard the man
stride toward the closet where she had hidden herself.
Instinctively, she burrowed back behind the fur garments
which her groping hands encountered.</p>
<p>The door was flung open and light flooded into the
closet. However, the teletype attendant seemed to
have no suspicion that anyone might be hiding there.
He pressed a button on the wall and then heaved
against the partition with his shoulder. The section of
wall, suspended on a pivot, slowly revolved. After
the man had passed through, it swung back into its
original position.</p>
<p>Penny waited several minutes and then came out of
her hiding place. She flung open the closet door to
admit more light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just as I thought!&rdquo; she muttered.</p>
<p>The closet, a long narrow room, was hung solidly
with fur coats!</p>
<p>&ldquo;So Maxine Miller was working for the hotel interests
after all,&rdquo; Penny told herself. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve stumbled
into something big!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Groping along the wall of the storage room, she
found a switch and pressed it. Again the partition revolved,
revealing a flight of stairs leading downward.
She slipped through and the wall slid into place behind
her.</p>
<p>The stairway was lighted with only one weak electric
bulb. Penny&rsquo;s body cast a grotesque shadow as
she cautiously descended. There were so many steps
that she decided they must lead to a basement in the
hotel.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">[184]</div>
<p>She reached the bottom at last and followed a narrow
sloping tunnel, past a large refrigerated vault
which she reasoned must contain a vast supply of additional
furs, and kept on until a blast of cool air struck
her face. Penny drew up sharply.</p>
<p>Directly ahead, at a bend in the tunnel, sat an armed
guard. He was reading a newspaper in the dim light,
holding it very close to the glaring bulb above his
chair.</p>
<p>Penny dared go no farther. Quietly retreating the
way she had come, she stole back up the long stairway.
At the top landing she found herself confronted
with a blank wall. After groping about for several
minutes, her hand encountered a tiny switch similar
to the one on the opposite side of the partition. She
pressed it, and the wall section revolved.</p>
<p>Letting herself out of the storage closet, Penny
started toward the door, only to pause as she heard
one of the teletypes thumping out a message. She
crossed over to the machine and stood waiting until
the line had been finished and a bell jingled. The
words were unintelligible in jumbled typewriting, and
Penny had no time to work out the code.</p>
<p>Tearing the copy paper neatly across, she thrust it
in the pocket of her jacket.</p>
<p>Fearing that at any moment the printer attendant
might return, Penny dared linger no longer. She went
to the door but to her surprise it would not open.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">[185]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Probably a special trick catch which automatically
locks whenever closed,&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;The only way
to get in or out is with a key, and I haven&rsquo;t one. That
means I&rsquo;ll have to risk my neck again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Going to the window she raised it and looked down.
All was clear below. Two courses lay open to her. She
could return the way she had come through the hotel,
or she might edge along the shelf past two other windows
to the fire escape, and thence to the ground.
Either way was fraught with danger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I should happen to meet Ralph Fergus or Harvey
Maxwell, I might not get away with my information,&rdquo;
Penny decided. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try the fire-escape.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Closing the window behind her, she flattened herself
along the building wall, and moved cautiously
along the ledge. She passed the first room in safety.
Then, as she was about to crawl past the second, the
square of window suddenly flared with light.</p>
<p>For a dreadful moment Penny thought that she had
been seen. She huddled against the wall and waited.
Nothing happened.</p>
<p>At last, regaining her courage, she dared to peep
into the lighted room. Two men stood with their backs
to the window, but she recognized them as Harvey
Maxwell and Ralph Fergus.</p>
<p>Penny received a distinct shock as her gaze wandered
to the third individual who sat in a chair by the bed.
The man was old Peter Jasko.</p>
<p>A low rumble of voices reached the girl&rsquo;s ears.
Harvey Maxwell was speaking:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">[186]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Jasko, have you thought it over? Are you
ready to sign the lease?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have the law on you, if I ever get out of here!&rdquo;
the old man said spiritedly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re keepin&rsquo; me against
my will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll stay here, Jasko, until you come to your
senses. We need that land, and we mean to have it.
Understand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t get me to sign, not if you keep me here
all night,&rdquo; Mr. Jasko muttered. &ldquo;Not if you keep me a
year!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may change your mind after you learn what
we can do,&rdquo; said Harvey Maxwell suavely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You aim to starve me, I reckon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, nothing so crude as that, my dear fellow.
In fact, we shall treat you most kindly. Doctor Corbin
will be here presently to examine you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doctor Corbin! That old quack from Morgantown!
What are you bringing him here for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Harvey Maxwell smiled and tapped his head significantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To give you a mental examination. You are known
to the good people of Pine Top as a very peculiar
fellow, so I doubt if anyone will question Doctor
Corbin&rsquo;s verdict.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean, you&rsquo;re aimin&rsquo; to have me adjudged insane?&rdquo;
Peter Jasko asked incredulously.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">[187]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly. How else can one explain your fanatical
hatred of skiing, your blind rages, your antagonism to
the more progressive interests? While it will be a pity
to bring disgrace upon your charming granddaughter,
there is no other way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not unless you decide to sign,&rdquo; added Ralph
Fergus. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re more than reasonable. We&rsquo;re willing
to pay you a fair price for the lease, more than the land
is worth. But we want it, see? And what we want we
take.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a couple of thievin&rsquo;, stealin&rsquo; crooks!&rdquo; Peter
Jasko shouted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so loud, and be careful of your words,&rdquo;
Harvey Maxwell warned. &ldquo;Or the gag goes on again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which do you prefer,&rdquo; Fergus went on. &ldquo;A tidy
little sum of money, or the asylum?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peter Jasko maintained a sullen silence, glaring at
the two hotel men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The doctor will be here at ten-thirty,&rdquo; said Harvey
Maxwell, looking at his watch. &ldquo;You will have less than
a half hour to decide.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My mind&rsquo;s made up now! You won&rsquo;t get anyone
to believe your cock and bull story. I&rsquo;ll tell &rsquo;em you
brought me here and held me prisoner&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And no one will believe you,&rdquo; smiled Maxwell.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll give out that you came to the hotel and started
running amuck. Dozens of employes will confirm the
story.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">[188]</div>
<p>&ldquo;For that matter, I&rsquo;m not sure you don&rsquo;t belong in
an asylum,&rdquo; muttered Fergus. &ldquo;Only a man who isn&rsquo;t
in his right mind would turn down the liberal proposition
we&rsquo;ve made you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I deal with no scoundrels!&rdquo; the old man defied
them.</p>
<p>Harvey Maxwell looked at his watch again. &ldquo;You
have exactly twenty-five minutes in which to make up
your mind, Jasko. We&rsquo;ll leave you alone to think it
over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fergus trussed up the old man&rsquo;s hands and placed
a gag in his mouth. Then the two hotel men left the
room, turning out the light and locking the door behind
them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">[189]</div>
<h2 id="c23"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">23</span>
<br /><i>RESCUE</i></h2>
<p>After the door had closed there was no further
sound for a moment. Then in the darkness Penny heard
a choked sob.</p>
<p>Moving closer to the window she tried to raise it.
Failing, she tapped lightly on the pane. Pressing her
lips close to the glass she called softly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid, Mr. Jasko! Keep up your courage!
I&rsquo;ll find a way to get you out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man could not answer so she had no way
of knowing whether or not he heard her words. Moving
back along the ledge she reached another window,
and upon testing it was elated to find that it could be
raised up.</p>
<p>She climbed through, lowered it behind her and
hastened to the door. Quietly letting herself out, she
went down the deserted hall to the next door. Without
a key she could not hope to get inside. For a fleeting
instant she wondered if she were not making a mistake
by delaying in starting after the authorities.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">[190]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I never could get back here in time,&rdquo; she told
herself. &ldquo;Maxwell will return in twenty-five minutes
with the doctor, possibly earlier. Jasko may sign the
paper before help could reach him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny was at a loss to know how to aid the old man.
As she stood debating, the cleaning woman whom she
had seen upon another occasion, came down the hall.
The girl determined upon a bold move.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder if you could help me?&rdquo; she said, going
to meet the woman. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve locked myself out of my
room. Do you have a master key?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it will unlock most of the bedrooms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The doors on this floor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All except number 27.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny took a two dollar bill from her jacket pocket
and thrust it into the woman&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, take this, and let me have the key.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t give it to you,&rdquo; the woman protested. &ldquo;Show
me your room and I&rsquo;ll unlock it for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re standing in front of it now. Number 29.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman stared. &ldquo;But these rooms aren&rsquo;t usually
given out, Miss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I assure you number 29 is very much occupied,&rdquo;
replied Penny. &ldquo;Unlock it, please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman hesitated, and finally inserted the key
in the lock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said Penny as she heard the latch
click. &ldquo;No, keep the two dollars. You are welcome
to it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">[191]</div>
<p>She waited until the maid had gone on down the hall
before letting herself into the dark room. Groping
for the electric switch, she turned it on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Jasko, you know me,&rdquo; she whispered as the
old man blinked and stared at her almost stupidly.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to get you out of here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She jerked the gag from his mouth, and unfastened
the cords which bound his wrists.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t dare go through the hotel lest we be
seen,&rdquo; she told him. &ldquo;I think we may be able to get
out by means of the fire escape. If luck is only with
us&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Making certain that the coast was clear, Penny led
the old man down the hall to a room which she knew
would be opposite the fire escape. She was afraid it
would be locked, but to her intense relief it had not
been secured.</p>
<p>Only a minute was required to cross the room, raise
the window and help Peter Jasko through it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t come with you,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I have something
else to do. Now listen closely. I want you to go to
Pine Top as fast as you can and bring the sheriff or
the police or whoever it is that would have authority
to arrest Fergus and Maxwell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I aim to do that on my own account,&rdquo; the old man
muttered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a debt to square with them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We both have,&rdquo; said Penny. &ldquo;Now this is what I
want you to do. If I&rsquo;m not in evidence when you get
back, bring the police to the Green Room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">[192]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s on this same floor. You go down the hall to the
left, enter an unmarked door into another corridor,
and finally through a green door which may be
guarded. If necessary, force an entrance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what it&rsquo;s all about,&rdquo; the old man
muttered. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll do as you say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And hurry!&rdquo; Penny urged.</p>
<p>She watched anxiously from the window until Peter
Jasko had reached the bottom of the fire escape in
safety. He ran across the yard, gaining the roadway
without having been observed.</p>
<p>Returning once more to the main corridor, Penny
glanced anxiously up and down. Hearing someone
moving about at the far end of the hall, she went to
investigate, certain that it was the cleaning woman
putting away her mops and broom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ain&rsquo;t locked out again?&rdquo; the maid asked as she
saw Penny standing beside her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but I have another request. How would you
like to earn some more money?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo; inquired the woman with quick interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you have an extra costume?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Costume?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dress, I mean. Like one you&rsquo;re wearing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not here.&rdquo; As the maid spoke she divested herself
of an old pair of shoes, and setting them back against
the closet wall, slipped on a pair of much better looking
ones. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m changing my clothes now to go home.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">[193]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you another two dollars if you&rsquo;ll lend me
the outfit for the evening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it for a party?&rdquo; the maid asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A masquerade,&rdquo; said Penny. &ldquo;I want to play a little
joke on some acquaintances of mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She waved another bill before the woman&rsquo;s eyes, and
the temptation of making easy money was too great to
resist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, I&rsquo;ll do it,&rdquo; the maid agreed. &ldquo;Just wait
outside until I get my clothes changed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny waited, watching the halls anxiously lest she
be observed by someone who would recognize her.
Soon the maid stepped from the closet, and handed
over a bundle of clothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And here is your money,&rdquo; said Penny. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mention
to anyone what we&rsquo;ve done&mdash;at least not until
tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, Miss, I won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; replied the woman
grimly. &ldquo;I might lose my job if they caught me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After the maid had gone away, Penny slipped into
the closet and quickly changed into the costume. Pulling
off her cap, she rumpled her hair and rubbed a
streak of dirt across her face. The shoes were a trifle
too large for her, and their size, together with the
painful ankle, made her walk in a dragging fashion.</p>
<p>Snatching up a feather duster, she went hurriedly
down the hall toward the corridor which led to the
Green Room. As always, the guard sat in his chair by
the door. But this time Penny had high hopes of gaining
entrance.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">[194]</div>
<p>Boldly, she walked over to him and said: &ldquo;Good
evening. I was sent to tell you you&rsquo;re wanted in the
office by Mr. Maxwell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now?&rdquo; he inquired in surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, right away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Someone ought to stay here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wait until you get back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let anyone inside unless they have passes,&rdquo;
the guard instructed.</p>
<p>Penny barely could hide her excitement. It had
been almost too easy! At last she was to penetrate beyond
the Green Door! And if she found what she
expected, the entire mystery would be cleared up.
She would gain evidence against Ralph Fergus and
Harvey Maxwell which would make her case iron-clad.</p>
<p>From within the room, Penny could hear the low
murmur of voices. She waited until the guard had disappeared,
and then, summoning her courage, opened
the green door and stepped inside.</p>
<p>Penny found herself in an elegantly furnished salon,
its chairs, davenports, carpet and draperies decorated
in soft shades of green and ivory. A little dark-haired
man she had never seen before, who spoke with an
artificial French accent, stood talking with three
women who were trying on fur coats. A fourth
woman, Maxine Miller, sat in a chair, her back turned
to Penny.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">[195]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now Henri, I want you to give my friends a good
price on their coats,&rdquo; she was saying in a chirpy voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Oui</i>&rdquo; he agreed, bobbing his head up and down.
&ldquo;We say one hundred and ninety-two dollars for zis
beautiful sealskin coat. I make you a special price only
because you are friends of Mademoiselle Miller.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The opening of the outside door had drawn Henri&rsquo;s
attention briefly to Penny. As she busied herself dusting,
he paid her no heed, and Maxine Miller did not
give the girl a second glance.</p>
<p>Penny wandered slowly about the room, noting the
long mirrors and the tall cases crowded with racks of
sealskin coats.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These are smuggled furs,&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;This
Green Room is the sales salon, and Henri must be an
employee of Ralph Fergus and Harvey Maxwell. I
believe I know how they get the furs over the Canadian
border, too, without paying duty!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Satisfied that she could learn no more by lingering,
Penny turned down the long corridor leading to the
door which opened on the main hallway. She knew
that the guard would soon discover he had been
tricked and expose her. And while she had been inside
the salon less than five minutes, already she had
waited a moment too long.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">[196]</div>
<p>As she opened the door she saw Harvey Maxwell
and the guard coming down the corridor toward her.
Retreat was out of the question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There she is now!&rdquo; said the guard, accusingly.
&ldquo;She told me you wanted me in the office.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Harvey Maxwell walked angrily toward Penny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was the big idea?&rdquo; he began, only to stop
short. &ldquo;Oh, so it&rsquo;s <i>you</i>? My dear little girl, I am very
much afraid, you have over-played your hand this
time!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">[197]</div>
<h2 id="c24"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">24</span>
<br /><i>HENRI&rsquo;S SALON</i></h2>
<p>Penny sought to push past the two men, but
Harvey Maxwell caught her roughly by the arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unfortunately, my dear Miss Parker, you have observed
certain things which you may not understand,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;Lest you misinterpret them, and are inclined
to run to your father with fantastic tales, you must be
detained here. Now I have a great distaste for violence.
I trust it will not be necessary to use force now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me go,&rdquo; Penny cried, trying to jerk away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take her, Frank,&rdquo; instructed the hotel man. &ldquo;For
the time being put her in the tunnel room. I&rsquo;ll be down
as soon as I talk with Ralph.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before Penny could scream, a hand was clapped
over her mouth. The guard, Frank, held her in a firm
grip from which she could not free herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get going!&rdquo; he commanded.</p>
<p>But Penny braced her feet and stood perfectly still.
From the outside corridor she had heard a low rumble
of voices. Then Ralph Fergus spoke above the others,
in an exasperated, harassed tone:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">[198]</div>
<p>&ldquo;This old man is crazy, I tell you! We never kept
him a prisoner in our hotel. We have a Green Room,
to be sure, but it is rented out to a man named Henri
Croix who is in the fur business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny&rsquo;s pulse quickened. Peter Jasko had carried
out her order and had brought the police!</p>
<p>Harvey Maxwell and the guard well comprehended
their danger. With a quick jerk of his head the hotel
man indicated a closet where Penny could be secreted.
As the two men tried to pull her to it, she sunk her
teeth into Frank&rsquo;s hand. His hold over her mouth relaxed
for an instant, but that instant was enough. She
screamed at the top of her lungs.</p>
<p>The outside door swung open. Led by Peter Jasko,
the sheriff and several deputies filed into the corridor.
Ralph Fergus did not follow, and Penny saw him trying
to slip away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let that man escape!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Arrest
him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peter Jasko himself overtook Fergus and brought
him back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a score to settle with you,&rdquo; he muttered.
&ldquo;You ain&rsquo;t a good enough talker to get out of this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gentlemen&mdash;&rdquo; It was Harvey Maxwell who spoke,
and his tone was irritated. &ldquo;What is the meaning of
this intrusion?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve had a complaint,&rdquo; said the sheriff. &ldquo;Jasko
here says you kept him a prisoner in the hotel, trying
to make him sign a paper.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">[199]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The old fellow is right in a way,&rdquo; replied Mr. Maxwell.
&ldquo;Not about the paper. We did detain him here
for his own good, and he managed to get away. I regret
to say he went completely out of his mind, became
violent, threatened our guests, and it was necessary
to hold him until the doctor could arrive. We&rsquo;ve
already sent for Doctor Corbin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just what I was telling them,&rdquo; added Ralph
Fergus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now let me speak my piece,&rdquo; said Penny. &ldquo;Peter
Jasko was held a prisoner here because Fergus and
Maxwell wanted him to sign a paper leasing his ski
slopes to the hotel. That was only one of their many
little stunts. Fergus and Maxwell are the heads of a
gigantic fur smuggling business, and they use their
hotels merely as a legitimate front.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your proof?&rdquo; demanded Harvey Maxwell sarcastically.
&ldquo;The real truth is that I am suing this girl&rsquo;s
father for libel. He sent her here to try to dig up something
against me. She&rsquo;s using every excuse she can
find to involve me in affairs about which I know
nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you want proof, I&rsquo;ll furnish it,&rdquo; said Penny.
&ldquo;Just step into the Green Room where Henri Croix,
a phony Frenchman, is engaged in selling fur coats to
three ladies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no crime in that,&rdquo; declared Ralph Fergus
angrily. &ldquo;Mr. Croix pays the hotel three hundred
dollars a month for the use of this wing. So far as we
know his business is legitimate. If for any reason we
learn it is not, we will be the first to ask for an investigation.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">[200]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not quite the first,&rdquo; smiled Penny, &ldquo;for I&rsquo;ve already
made the request. To go on with my proof, it
might be well to investigate Room 27 on this same
floor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Room 27 is given over to our teletype service,&rdquo;
interrupted Maxwell. &ldquo;Our guests like to get the stock
reports, you know, and that is why we have the machines.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In Room 27 you will find a storage vault for furs,&rdquo;
Penny went on, thoroughly enjoying herself. &ldquo;A panel
revolves, opening the way to a secret stair which leads
down into the basement of the hotel. I&rsquo;m not certain
about the rest&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No?&rdquo; demanded Maxwell ironically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are additional storage vaults in the basement,&rdquo;
Penny resumed. &ldquo;A man is down there guarding
what appears to be a tunnel. Tell me, is this hotel
close to the old silver mine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About a quarter of a mile from the entrance,&rdquo; replied
the sheriff. &ldquo;Some of the tunnels might come
right up to the hotel grounds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I understand the hotel bought out the mine, and I
believe they may be making use of the old tunnels. At
least, the place will bear an investigation. Oh, yes, this
paper came off one of the teletype machines.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">[201]</div>
<p>Penny took the torn sheet from her pocket and gave
it to the sheriff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t read it,&rdquo; he said, frowning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Code,&rdquo; explained Penny. &ldquo;If I had a typewriter I
could figure it out. Suppose we go to Room 27 now.
I&rsquo;m positive you&rsquo;ll learn that my story is not as fantastic
as it seems.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leaving Peter Jasko and two deputies to guard
Fergus and Maxwell and to see that no one left the
Green Room, Penny led the sheriff and four other
armed men down the hall. In her excitement she failed
to observe Francine Sellberg standing by the elevator,
watching intently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here are the teletype machines,&rdquo; Penny indicated,
pausing beside them. &ldquo;Now let me have that message.
I think I can read it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Studying the keyboard of the teletype for a moment,
she wrote out her translation beneath the
jumbled line of printing. It read:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Train Arrives approximately 11:25.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does that mean?&rdquo; the sheriff inquired. &ldquo;We
have no trains at Pine Top.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see,&rdquo; chuckled Penny.</p>
<p>She showed the men the vault filled with furs, and
pressed the spring which opened the wall panel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be careful in descending the stairway,&rdquo; she warned.
&ldquo;I know they have one guard down there and possibly
others.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">[202]</div>
<p>Sheriff Clausson and his men went ahead of Penny.
The guard, taken completely by surprise, was captured
without a shot being fired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now what have we here?&rdquo; the sheriff inquired,
peering into the dimly lighted tunnel.</p>
<p>As far as one could see stretched a narrow, rusted
track with an extra rail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A miniature electric railway!&rdquo; exclaimed the
sheriff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How far is it from here to the border?&rdquo; inquired
Penny thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not more than a mile.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been told Harvey Maxwell has a hotel located
in Canada.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; nodded the sheriff, following her thought.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve known for years that furs were being smuggled,
but we never once suspected the outfit was located
here at Pine Top. And no wonder. This scheme
is clever, so elaborate a fellow never would think of
it. The underground railroad, complete with drainage
pumps, storage rooms and electric lights, crosses the
border and connects with the Canadian hotel. Fergus
and Maxwell buy furs cheap and send them here without
paying duty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And teletype communication is maintained just as
it is on a real railroad,&rdquo; added Penny. &ldquo;Fergus and
Maxwell must have bought up the old mine just so
they could make use of the tunnels. And they wanted
to get rid of Mrs. Downey&rsquo;s Inn so there would be no
possible danger of a leak. How large do you suppose
the smuggling ring is, Mr. Clausson?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">[203]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Large enough. Likely it will take weeks to get all
of the guilty persons rounded up. But I&rsquo;m satisfied we
have the main persons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I interpreted the code message right, a fur train
should be coming in about eleven-thirty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My men will be waiting,&rdquo; the sheriff said grimly.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get busy now and tip off the Canadian authorities,
so they can close in on the gang from the other end of
the line.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about Fergus and Maxwell?&rdquo; asked Penny.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no chance they can trump up a story and get
free?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a chance,&rdquo; returned the sheriff gruffly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve
done your work, and now I&rsquo;ll do mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny started to turn away, then paused. &ldquo;Oh, may
I ask a favor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon you&rsquo;ve earned it,&rdquo; the sheriff answered,
a twinkle in his eye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s one person involved in this mess who isn&rsquo;t
really to blame. An actress named Maxine Miller.
She&rsquo;s only been working for the hotel a few days, and
I doubt if she knows what it&rsquo;s all about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll give her every benefit of the doubt,&rdquo; promised
the sheriff. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll remember the name. Miller.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_204">[204]</div>
<p>In a daze of excitement Penny rushed back up the
stairway to the Green Room. Fergus and Maxwell,
Henri Croix, and Maxine Miller were in custody, all
angrily protesting their innocence. The commotion
had brought many hotel guests to the scene. Questions
were flying thick and fast.</p>
<p>Penny drew Peter Jasko aside to talk with him
privately.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you ought to go to Mrs. Downey&rsquo;s lodge
as soon as you can,&rdquo; she urged. &ldquo;Sara is there, and she&rsquo;s
dreadfully worried about you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go now,&rdquo; the old man said, offering his gnarled
hand. &ldquo;Much obliged for all you done tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s quite all right,&rdquo; replied Penny. &ldquo;I was
lucky or I never would have discovered where those
men were keeping you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man hesitated, obviously wishing to say
something more, yet unable to find the words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I done some thinkin&rsquo; tonight,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;I
reckon I been too strict with Sara. From now on maybe
I&rsquo;ll let her have a looser rein.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And ski all she likes,&rdquo; urged Penny. &ldquo;I really can&rsquo;t
see the harm in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I been thinkin&rsquo; about that lease, too,&rdquo; the old man
added, not looking directly at the girl. &ldquo;When I see
Mrs. Downey tonight I&rsquo;ll tell her I&rsquo;m ready to sign.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m so glad!&rdquo; Penny exclaimed. &ldquo;With the
Fergus-Maxwell hotel out of the running, she ought
to have a comfortable time of it here on Pine Top
mountain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks to you,&rdquo; grinned Peter Jasko. He offered
his hand again and Penny gave it a firm pressure.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_205">[205]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I must hurry now,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;This is a tremendous
story, and I want to telegraph it to Dad before Francine
Sellberg beats me to the jump.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sellberg?&rdquo; repeated the old man. &ldquo;She ain&rsquo;t that
girl reporter that&rsquo;s been stayin&rsquo; here at the hotel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you better step,&rdquo; he advised. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s on her
way to the village now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how could Francine have learned about it so
soon?&rdquo; Penny wailed in dismay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw her talking with one of the deputies. She
was writing things down in a notebook.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She couldn&rsquo;t have learned everything, but probably
enough to ruin my story. When did Francine leave,
Mr. Jasko?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All of fifteen minutes ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I never can overtake her,&rdquo; Penny murmured.
&ldquo;This is absolutely the worst break yet! Francine will
reach the telegraph office first and hold the wire so I
can&rsquo;t use it. After all my work, her paper will get
the big scoop!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_206">[206]</div>
<h2 id="c25"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">25</span>
<br /><i>SCOOP!</i></h2>
<p>Penny knew that she had only one chance of
getting her story through to Riverview, and that was
by means of long distance telephone. At best, instead
of achieving a scoop as she had hoped, she would have
only an even break with her rival. And if connections
could not be quickly made, she would lose out altogether.</p>
<p>Hastily saying goodbye to Peter Jasko, Penny raced
for the stairway. She did not have a word of her story
written down. While she could give the facts to a
rewrite man it would take him some time to get the
article into shape.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vic Henderson writes such colorless stories, too,&rdquo;
she moaned to herself. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be afraid some fact isn&rsquo;t
accurate and he&rsquo;ll jerk it out. This is the one yarn I
want to write myself!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny ran full tilt into Sheriff Clausson. She brought
up shortly, observing that he had a prisoner in custody.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Parker, we caught this fellow down in the
tunnel,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Can you identify him?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_207">[207]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure of his name. He works for Fergus
and Maxwell as a teletype attendant. He may be
George Jewitt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny started to hasten on, and then struck by a
sudden idea, paused. Addressing the prisoner she demanded:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it true that there is a direct wire connection
between this hotel and the one in Riverview?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man did not speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may as well answer up,&rdquo; said the sheriff. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
something which can be checked easily.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, there is a direct connection,&rdquo; answered the
attendant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if I know anything about leased wires,&rdquo; continued
Penny with mounting excitement, &ldquo;it would be
possible to have the telephone company switch that
wire right over to the <i>Riverview Star</i> office. Then I&rsquo;d
have a direct connection from here to the newspaper.
Right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right except for one minor detail,&rdquo; the man retorted
sarcastically. &ldquo;The telephone company won&rsquo;t
make a switch just to oblige a little girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny&rsquo;s face fell. &ldquo;I suppose they wouldn&rsquo;t do it,&rdquo;
she admitted. &ldquo;But what a whale of an idea! I could
send my story directly to the newspaper, and get my
scoop after all. As it is, the <i>Record</i> is almost certain
to beat me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_208">[208]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; said the sheriff. &ldquo;Maybe the telephone
company couldn&rsquo;t make the switch on your say-so,
but they&rsquo;ll pay attention to an order from me. You get
busy writing that story, young lady, and we&rsquo;ll see
what can be done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sheriff Clausson turned his prisoner over to a
deputy, and returned to find Penny busily scribbling
on the back of an envelope, the only writing paper
available. Together they went to the long distance
telephone, and in a quicker time than the girl had
dared hope, arrangements were made for the wire
shift to be made.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now get up to Room 27 and start your story going
out,&rdquo; the sheriff urged. &ldquo;Will you need the attendant
to turn on the current for you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I know how it&rsquo;s done!&rdquo; Penny declared.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re sure the connection has been made?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The telephone company reports everything is set.
So go to it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny hobbled as fast as her injured ankle would
permit to Room 27. She switched on the light, and
turned on the current which controlled the teletype
machines. Sitting down at a chair in front of the direct
keyboard, she found herself trembling from excitement.
She had practiced only a few times and was
afraid she might make mistakes. Every word she wrote
would be transmitted in exactly that form to a similar
machine stationed in the <i>Star</i> office.</p>
<p>She could picture her father standing there, waiting,
wondering what she would send. He had been
warned that a big story was coming.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">[209]</div>
<p>Penny consulted her envelope notes and began to
tap the keys. Now and then she had moments of misgiving,
wondering if her work was accurate, and if it
were going through. She finished at last, and sat back
with a weary sigh of relief. Her story was a good one.
She knew that. But had it ever reached the <i>Star</i> office?</p>
<p>A machine to her right began its rhythmical thumping.
Startled, Penny sprang to her feet and rushed
over to see the message which was slowly printing
itself across the copy paper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;STORY RECEIVED OK. WONDERFUL
STUFF. CAN YOU GET AN INTERVIEW
WITH SHERIFF CLAUSSON?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny laughed aloud, and went back to her own
machine to tap out an answer. Her line had a flippant
note:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;LL HAUL HIM UP HERE AS SOON AS
THE 11:30 TRAIN COMES IN. LET ME TALK
TO DAD.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a little wait and then the return message
came in over the other teletype.</p>
<p>&ldquo;YOU&rsquo;VE BEEN TALKING WITH HIM. AM
SENDING SALT SOMMERS BY PLANE TO
GET PICTURES. SORRY I DIDN&rsquo;T TAKE YOU
SERIOUSLY WHEN YOU WROTE MAXWELL
WAS INVOLVED IN ILLEGAL BUSINESS AT
PINE TOP. THIS OUGHT TO MOP UP HIS
SUIT AGAINST THE PAPER. GREAT STUFF,
PENNY! WHO UNCOVERED THE STORY?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_210">[210]</div>
<p>Chuckling to herself, Penny went back to her keyboard
and tapped:</p>
<p>&ldquo;DON&rsquo;T ASK ME. I&rsquo;M TRYING TO BE MODEST.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She waited eagerly for the response and it came in
a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I WAS AFRAID OF IT. ARE YOU ALL
RIGHT?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thoroughly enjoying the little game of questions
and answers, Penny once more tapped her message.</p>
<p>&ldquo;FINE AS SILK. WHEN ARE YOU COMING
TO PINE TOP? WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO
GIVE ME FOR XMAS? IT SHOULD BE SOMETHING
GOOD AFTER THIS.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Soon Mr. Parker&rsquo;s reply appeared on the moving
sheet of paper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;SOON. PERHAPS SOMETHING WITH
FOUR WHEELS AND A HORN.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny scarcely could control herself long enough
to send back:</p>
<p>&ldquo;OH, YOU WONDERFUL DAD! I COULD
HUG YOU! PLEASE MAKE IT MAROON
WITH MOHAIR UPHOLSTERY. AND HANG
A WREATH ON LEAPING LENA.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_211">[211]</div>
<p>Sinking back in her chair, Penny gazed dreamily
at the ceiling. A new car! It was almost too good to
believe. She knew that her father must have been
swayed by excitement or else very grateful to offer
such a magnificent Christmas present as that. What a
night of thrills it had been! Within a few hours Pine
Top would be crowded with reporters and photographers,
but she had uncovered the story, and had saved
her father from a disastrous lawsuit.</p>
<p>As Penny waited, her thoughts far away, one more
message came through on the teletype. She tore it
from the roller of the machine, and smiled as she read
her father&rsquo;s final words:</p>
<p>&ldquo;PRESSES ROLLING. FIRST EDITION ON
THE STREET AHEAD OF THE RECORD. THE
STAR SCORES AGAIN. THIS IS ANTHONY
PARKER SIGNING OFF FOR A CUP OF COFFEE.&rdquo;</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with

If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
